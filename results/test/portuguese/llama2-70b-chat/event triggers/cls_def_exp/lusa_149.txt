Please note that the input text is in Portuguese and the output should be in English.

Also, please note that the task is to extract and classify all event triggers, not to extract all events.

Event triggers are words or phrases that indicate the occurrence of an event, such as "pediu" (asked), "expressou" (expressed), "ocorreu" (happened), "foi detido" (was detained), etc.

The classification of event triggers should be done according to the following classes:

* State: refers to a situation or condition that exists or persists over a period of time.
* Occurrence: refers to an event or happening that takes place at a specific point in time or over a limited period of time.
* Reporting: refers to the act of reporting or describing an event or situation.
* Perception: refers to the way an event or situation is perceived or experienced by someone.
* Aspectual: refers to the way an event or situation is viewed or considered in terms of its aspects or features.
* Intensional Action: refers to an action or activity that is intended or planned.
* Intensional State: refers to a state or condition that is intended or planned.

Please note that some event triggers may belong to more than one class, depending on the context and the specific meaning of the sentence.

It's important to mention that this task is a simplified version of a larger task, which is to extract and classify all events and event triggers from a text, and it's being used to train a model for that larger task.
