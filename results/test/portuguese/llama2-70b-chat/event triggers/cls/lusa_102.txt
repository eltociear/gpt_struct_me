This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the input text into one of the seven classes: State, Occurrence, Reporting, Perception, Aspectual, Intensional Action, and Intensional State.

The input text is a news article about a man who was detained by the police due to suspicions of setting fire to a residential building in Espinho, Portugal.
