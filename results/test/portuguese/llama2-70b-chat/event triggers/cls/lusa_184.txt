Note:
The output is a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class. The classes are:

* State: refers to a state or condition of something
* Occurrence: refers to an event or happening
* Reporting: refers to the act of reporting or describing an event
* Aspectual: refers to the aspect or way in which something happens
* Intensional Action: refers to an action that is intended or planned
* Intensional State: refers to a state or condition that is intended or planned

In this task, you are given a piece of news in Portuguese and are asked to extract and classify all event triggers, which are the words or phrases that indicate the occurrence of an event. The event triggers should be classified into the six classes mentioned above.

The input is a piece of news in Portuguese that describes a fatal accident that occurred in Famalicão, where a man fell from a roof while working and died. The output should be a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class.

For example, the entity "Homem" (man) should be classified as "State", since it refers to a state or condition of something (a person). The entity "morreu" (died) should be classified as "Occurrence", since it refers to an event or happening. The entity "cair" (fell) should be classified as "Reporting", since it refers to the act of reporting or describing an event. The entity "telhado" (roof) should be classified as "Aspectual", since it refers to the aspect or way in which something happens (the man fell from the roof). The entity "trabalhava" (worked) should be classified as "Intensional Action", since it refers to an action that is intended or planned. The entity "hoje" (today) should be classified as "Intensional State", since it refers to a state or condition that is intended or planned (the man was planning to work today).

The rest of the entities in the input text should be classified accordingly, based on their grammatical function and meaning in the context of the sentence. The output should be a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class.
