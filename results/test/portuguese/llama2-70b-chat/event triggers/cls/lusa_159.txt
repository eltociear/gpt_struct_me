Note:
The input text is in Portuguese, and the output should be in English.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the input text into one of the seven classes: State, Occurrence, Reporting, Perception, Aspectual, Intensional Action, and Intensional State.

The input text is a news article about a drug bust at an airport in Guinea-Bissau. The article mentions the Police Judiciária (PJ) of Guinea-Bissau, a man who was detained with three kilograms of cocaine, and several other individuals who were also detained in connection with the drug bust.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class. For example, the entity "PJ da Guiné-Bissau" should be classified as "State", and the entity "homem" (man) should be classified as "Occurrence".

The classes are defined as follows:

* State: refers to a general state or condition, such as a location or an organization.
* Occurrence: refers to an event or a happening, such as a drug bust or a detention.
* Reporting: refers to the act of reporting or describing an event, such as a news article.
* Perception: refers to a person's perception or understanding of an event, such as a witness's account of a drug bust.
* Aspectual: refers to a detail or aspect of an event, such as the weight of the drugs or the destination of a flight.
* Intensional Action: refers to an action that is intended or planned, such as a person's attempt to board a flight with drugs.
* Intensional State: refers to a state or condition that is intended or planned, such as a person's intended destination or a drug trafficker's intended market.

The output should be in English, and the entities and classes should be in lowercase.
