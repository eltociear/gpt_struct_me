Note:
The input text is in Portuguese, and the output should be in English.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the input text into one of the seven classes: State, Occurrence, Reporting, Perception, Aspectual, Intensional Action, and Intensional State.

The input text is a news article about a man who was arrested for physically and psychologically abusing his mother. The text includes information about the man's age, the fact that he had been prohibited from contacting or being near his mother, and the fact that he had previously been arrested for similar crimes. The text also includes information about the man's actions, such as threatening and coercing his mother, and destroying property.

The output should be a list of pairs, where each pair consists of an entity (such as "Homem" or "mãe") and a class (such as "State" or "Intensional Action"). The class should be the appropriate one for the entity in the context of the input text.

For example, the entity "Homem" should be classified as "State" because it refers to the man's current state of being arrested. The entity "33 anos" should be classified as "Aspectual" because it refers to the man's age, which is an aspect of his current state. The entity "agredir física e psicologicamente" should be classified as "Intensional Action" because it refers to the man's intention to physically and psychologically abuse his mother.

The output should be in JSON format, which is a parseable list of pairs. Each pair should be a list with two strings: the first string should be the entity, and the second string should be the class.

The task requires understanding the meaning of the entities in the context of the input text and classifying them accordingly. It also requires knowledge of the seven classes and their meanings.
