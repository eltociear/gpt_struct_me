Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the input text into one of the seven classes: State, Occurrence, Reporting, Perception, Aspectual, Intensional Action, and Intensional State.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, in the output, "Homem" is classified as "State", "32 anos" is classified as "Aspectual", "rio Tua" is classified as "Occurrence", and so on.

The classes are defined as follows:

* State: refers to a state or condition of something or someone. Examples: "homem", "mulher", "rio", "paisagem".
* Occurrence: refers to an event or a happening. Examples: "encontrado", "morto", "desaparecimento", "buscas".
* Reporting: refers to the act of reporting or describing an event or situation. Examples: "informou", "informação", "relatou".
* Perception: refers to the act of perceiving or sensing something. Examples: "encontrado", "visto", " ouvido".
* Aspectual: refers to a temporary or changing aspect of something. Examples: "32 anos", "madrugada", "domingo".
* Intensional Action: refers to an action that is intended or planned. Examples: "ir pescar", "sair de casa", "iniciar buscas".
* Intensional State: refers to a state or condition that is intended or planned. Examples: "Polícia Judiciária", "ser apuradas as circunstâncias da morte".

Note that some entities may be classified into more than one class, depending on their context and meaning in the sentence.
