Note:
The output is a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class. The classes are:

* State: Indicates a state or a situation
* Occurrence: Indicates an event or an occurrence
* Reporting: Indicates a report or a statement
* Perception: Indicates a perception or an observation
* Aspectual: Indicates an aspect or a feature
* Intensional Action: Indicates an action with an intention
* Intensional State: Indicates a state with an intention

In this task, you have to extract and classify all event triggers in the given text. An event trigger is a word or a phrase that indicates an event or an occurrence. For example, in the sentence "The man killed his children", "killed" is an event trigger.

The output should be a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class. For example, in the sentence "The man killed his children", the output would be [["killed", "Action"]].

Note that some words or phrases may have multiple classes. For example, in the sentence "The man killed his children", "killed" could also be classified as an Intensional Action, as it indicates an action with an intention.

You can use the following classes to classify the event triggers:

* State: Indicates a state or a situation
* Occurrence: Indicates an event or an occurrence
* Reporting: Indicates a report or a statement
* Perception: Indicates a perception or an observation
* Aspectual: Indicates an aspect or a feature
* Intensional Action: Indicates an action with an intention
* Intensional State: Indicates a state with an intention

You can use the JSON-parseable list format to output the results. For example, [["Detido", "State"], ["pai", "State"], ["matou", "Action"], ["filhos", "State"], ["para se vingar", "Intensional Action"], ["da mulher", "Intensional State"]] would be a valid output for the given text.
