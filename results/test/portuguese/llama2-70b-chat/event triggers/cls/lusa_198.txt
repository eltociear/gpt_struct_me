Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and a different set of classes. As before, your goal is to extract and classify all event triggers in the given text.

The classes in this task are:

* State: Represents a state of being or a condition.
* Occurrence: Represents an event or a happening.
* Reporting: Represents a report or a statement about an event.
* Perception: Represents a perception or an observation.
* Aspectual: Represents an aspect or a feature of an event.
* Intensional Action: Represents an action that is intended or planned.
* Intensional State: Represents a state that is intended or planned.

For example, in the sentence "Grua de camião derrubou poste de iluminação no Porto e matou homem de 52 anos", the word "derrubou" would be classified as an Occurrence, and the word "matou" would be classified as an Intensional State.

As before, your output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

Note that the input text is in Portuguese, so you may need to use a Portuguese language model or dictionary to accurately classify the words.
