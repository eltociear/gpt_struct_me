Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the input text into one of the seven classes: State, Occurrence, Reporting, Perception, Aspectual, Intensional Action, and Intensional State.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, the entity "Tribunal de Viana do Castelo" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal institution. The entity "homem" should be classified as "Occurrence", because it refers to an event or a happening. The entity "matou" should be classified as "Action", because it refers to an action performed by someone. The entity "outro" should be classified as "Occurrence", because it refers to an event or a happening. The entity "a tiro" should be classified as "Aspectual", because it refers to the way something happened. The entity "12 anos de prisão" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal penalty.

The entity "homicídio qualificado" should be classified as "Intensional Action", because it refers to a crime that was intended to be committed. The entity "homicídio simples" should also be classified as "Intensional Action", because it refers to a crime that was intended to be committed, but without the aggravating circumstances that would make it a "homicídio qualificado". The entity "arma do crime" should be classified as "Intensional State", because it refers to the state of being a weapon used in a crime.

The entity "juiz presidente do coletivo" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal institution. The entity "arguido" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal status. The entity "prisão preventiva" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal penalty. The entity "sete anos em fuga" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal status. The entity "acusado" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal status.

The entity "crime de ofensa à integridade física qualificada" should be classified as "Intensional Action", because it refers to a crime that was intended to be committed. The entity "crime de detenção de arma proibida" should also be classified as "Intensional Action", because it refers to a crime that was intended to be committed. The entity "prova documental e testemunhal" should be classified as "State", because it refers to evidence presented in a legal case. The entity "julgamento" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal process. The entity "indemnização" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal penalty. The entity "mãe da vítima mortal" should be classified as "State", because it refers to a legal status.

Note that some entities may have multiple possible classes, depending on the context in which they are used. For example, the entity "outro" could also be classified as "Occurrence", depending on the context
