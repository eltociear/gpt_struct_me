Note:

* The input text is in Portuguese.
* The output format is a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.
* The classes are: State, Occurrence, Reporting, Perception, Aspectual, Intensional Action, and Intensional State.
* The entity recognition is based on the context and the part-of-speech of the word.
* The class assignment is based on the meaning of the word in the context of the sentence.

This task is a sample task for the development of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system in Portuguese. The goal is to extract and classify all event triggers in a given text, where an event trigger is a word or a phrase that indicates the occurrence of an event or a state. The system should be able to recognize entities and classify them into different categories based on their meaning in the context of the sentence.

The input text is a news article about the Portuguese Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR) seizing various weapons during a domestic violence investigation. The output should be a list of all event triggers in the text, along with their corresponding classes.

For example, the word "GNR" should be classified as a State, as it refers to the Guarda Nacional Republicana, which is a state institution. The word "apreende" should be classified as an Occurrence, as it indicates the act of seizing something. The phrase "varios tipos de armas de fogo" should be classified as an Aspectual, as it describes the weapons that were seized. The phrase "em ação contra violência doméstica" should be classified as an Intensional Action, as it indicates the purpose of the seizure.

The output format is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class. This format allows for easy integration with other NLP tasks and systems.

This task is a basic example of event extraction, which is an important task in NLP. Event extraction systems can be used for various applications, such as information retrieval, text summarization, and machine translation.
