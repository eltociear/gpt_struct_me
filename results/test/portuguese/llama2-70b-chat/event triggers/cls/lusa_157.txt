Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and a different set of classes. As before, your goal is to extract and classify all event triggers in the input text.

The classes in this task are:

* State: Represents a state or a situation.
* Occurrence: Represents an event or a happening.
* Reporting: Represents a report or a statement about an event.
* Perception: Represents a perception or a sensory experience.
* Aspectual: Represents an aspect or a feature of an event.
* Intensional Action: Represents an action that is intended or planned.
* Intensional State: Represents a state that is intended or planned.

For example, in the input text, "Homem morre atingido por árvore em Monção" can be classified as a State, because it describes a situation where a man has died after being hit by a tree. "59 anos" can be classified as an Aspectual, because it describes an aspect of the man's age. "atingido por uma árvore" can be classified as an Occurrence, because it describes an event where the man was hit by a tree.

You can use the same approach as before, using Named Entity Recognition and Part-of-Speech tagging to identify the entities and their parts of speech, and then applying the appropriate classifications based on their meanings and contexts.

Please provide your answer in the format of a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings, the first string representing the entity and the second string representing the class.
