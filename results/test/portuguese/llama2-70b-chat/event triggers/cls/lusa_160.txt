Explanation:

* "MP" is a State entity because it refers to the Ministry of Public, which is a legal entity that is responsible for the accusation.
* "homem" is an Occurrence entity because it refers to the man who is being accused.
* "abusar" is an Action entity because it refers to the action of abusing.
* "filha" is an Aspectual entity because it refers to the daughter, who is the victim of the abuse.
* "companheira" is a State entity because it refers to the companion, who is the mother of the victim.
* "Braga" and "Amares" are Location entities because they refer to the places where the abuse occurred.
* "2017" and "2019" are Time entities because they refer to the years when the abuse started and ended.
* "trato sexual" is an Intensional Action entity because it refers to the sexual contact that the man had with the daughter.
* "sós" is an Intensional State entity because it refers to the fact that the man was alone with the daughter during the abuse.

Note that some entities can have multiple classes. For example, "filha" can also be considered a State entity because it refers to the daughter's state of being a victim of abuse. Similarly, "companheira" can also be considered a State entity because it refers to the companion's state of being the mother of the victim. However, for the purpose of this task, we are only considering the primary class of each entity.
