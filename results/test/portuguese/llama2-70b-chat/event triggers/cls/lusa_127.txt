Note:
The input text is in Portuguese, and the output should be in English.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the input text into one of the seven classes: State, Occurrence, Reporting, Perception, Aspectual, Intensional Action, and Intensional State.

The input text is a news article about a restaurant that was shut down by the GNR (National Republican Guard) in Freamunde, Portugal, due to a violation of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. The article mentions various entities, such as the restaurant, the GNR, the proprietor, and the military, and describes their actions and states.

The output should be a list of pairs, where each pair consists of an entity and its corresponding class. For example, "Covid-19" should be classified as "Occurrence", "GNR de Freamunde" should be classified as "State", and "reunia 50 pessoas" should be classified as "Aspectual".

The classes are defined as follows:

* State: A state or condition of something.
* Occurrence: An event or happening.
* Reporting: A report or statement about something.
* Perception: A perception or observation of something.
* Aspectual: A description of the way something is or appears.
* Intensional Action: An action that is intended or planned.
* Intensional State: A state or condition that is intended or planned.

The task requires identifying the entities in the input text and determining which class best describes their meaning in the context of the text. The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a pair of an entity and its class.
