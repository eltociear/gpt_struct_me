Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the input text into one of the seven classes: State, Occurrence, Reporting, Perception, Aspectual, Intensional Action, and Intensional State.

The output is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, the entity "Homem" is classified as "State", because it refers to a person's state. The entity "hoje" is classified as "Occurrence", because it refers to an event that is happening now. The entity "manuseava" is classified as "Intensional Action", because it refers to an action that is being performed intentionally. The entity "gasolina" is classified as "Aspectual", because it refers to a substance that has a particular aspect or property. The entity "na face e nos membros superiores" is classified as "Perception", because it refers to a perception or sensation.

The entity "sofreu" is classified as "State", because it refers to a person's state. The entity "queimaduras" is classified as "State", because it refers to a state of being burned. The entity "segundo e terceiro graus" is classified as "Aspectual", because it refers to a particular aspect or property of the burns. The entity "Hospital de São João" is classified as "State", because it refers to a place. The entity "Porto" is classified as "State", because it refers to a place. The entity "13:41" is classified as "Reporting", because it refers to a specific time. The entity "Fonte dos Bombeiros Voluntários Famalicenses" is classified as "Reporting", because it refers to a source of information. The entity "Lusa" is classified as "Reporting", because it refers to a news agency. The entity "acidente" is classified as "Occurrence", because it refers to an event that happened. The entity "manuseamento de gasolina" is classified as "Intensional Action", because it refers to an action that was performed intentionally. The entity "VMER" is classified as "State", because it refers to a medical vehicle. The entity "Hospital de Famalicão" is classified as "State", because it refers to a place. The entity "Braga" is classified as "State", because it refers to a place.

The task requires identifying the entities in the input text and classifying them into the appropriate class based on their meaning and context. It is important to note that the classes are not mutually exclusive, and an entity can belong to multiple classes.
