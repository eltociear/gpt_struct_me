Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different language and a different set of entities. Your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the text, including people, organizations, locations, and facilities.

As before, you can use any techniques you like to solve the task, including named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, or any other methods you have learned. You can also use pre-trained models or tools, such as spaCy or Stanford CoreNLP, to help you with the task.

When you are ready, submit your answer in the format specified in the task description. Good luck!
