Note:
The output is a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class. The classes are:

* Person: A person or group of people
* Organization: A company, institution, or organization
* Object: A physical object or entity
* Location: A place or location
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a plant or animal
* Facility: A building or structure designed for a specific purpose
* Other: Any entity that does not fit into the above categories

In this task, we are given a piece of news in Portuguese and are asked to extract and classify all participants mentioned in the text. The output should be a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class.

The input text is about a car accident that occurred in Barcelos, Portugal, in which a 48-year-old man died and a 20-year-old person was injured. The text mentions various entities, including people, locations, organizations, and objects.

The output list contains 16 pairs, each consisting of an entity and its class. The classes are:

* Person: 5 pairs (Homem, condutor, vítima, ferido ligeiro, Bombeiros Voluntários de Viatodos)
* Location: 4 pairs (Barcelos, Chorente, Braga, Viatodos)
* Object: 2 pairs (automóveis ligeiros, Hospital de Barcelos)
* Organization: 3 pairs (Comando Distrital de Operações de Socorros, CDOS, Bombeiros Voluntários de Viatodos)
* Event: 2 pairs (colisão automóvel, acidente)
* Time: 1 pair (13:00)
* Number: 1 pair (48)
* Other: 2 pairs (morre, hoje)

Note that some entities can fit into multiple classes. For example, "Bombeiros Voluntários de Viatodos" can be classified as both an organization and a location. In such cases, it's up to the discretion of the annotator to choose the most appropriate class.
