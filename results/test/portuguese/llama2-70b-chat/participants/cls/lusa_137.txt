Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each participant in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person or group of people, including their names, ages, and roles.
* Organization: A company, institution, or organization, including government agencies and NGOs.
* Object: A physical object or entity, such as a building, vehicle, or animal.
* Location: A geographical location, including cities, towns, and natural features.
* Nature: A natural phenomenon or entity, such as a river, mountain, or weather event.
* Facility: A man-made structure or entity, such as a hospital, school, or website.
* Other: Any entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second string is the class.
