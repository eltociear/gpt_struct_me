Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each participant in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person or individual involved in the event.
* Organization: A group or organization involved in the event.
* Object: A physical object or entity involved in the event.
* Location: A location or place where the event occurred.
* Nature: A natural phenomenon or force involved in the event.
* Facility: A man-made structure or facility involved in the event.
* Other: Any other participant that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second string is the class.

In this example, the input text describes a fire that occurred in a residential building in Espinho, Portugal. The participants in the event include a person who was detained by the police, the police force itself, the building where the fire occurred, the fire itself, the volunteer firefighters who extinguished the fire, and the judiciary police who will investigate the incident.

The output for this input text would be:
