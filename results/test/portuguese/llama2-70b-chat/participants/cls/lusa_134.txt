Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and classes. Your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the text, and output them in a JSON-parseable list.

The classes in this task are:

* Person: A person or group of people involved in the event.
* Organization: A company, institution, or organization involved in the event.
* Object: A physical object or entity involved in the event.
* Location: A location where the event took place or is related to.
* Nature: A natural entity or phenomenon involved in the event.
* Facility: A building, structure, or other man-made entity involved in the event.
* Other: Any other entity or concept involved in the event that doesn't fit into the above categories.

As before, the output should be a list of pairs, where each pair consists of the entity and its corresponding class.
