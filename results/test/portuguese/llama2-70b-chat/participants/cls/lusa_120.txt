Note:
The output format is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two elements: the entity and its corresponding class.

In this task, you are given a news article in Portuguese and are asked to extract and classify all participants mentioned in the text. The classes are: Person, Organization, Object, Location, Nature, Facility, and Other. Your output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the entity and its class.

The input article describes a serious incident where a young man was shot in the chest in the Amadora district of Lisbon. The article mentions various entities, including the victim, the location of the incident, the police forces involved, and the hospital where the victim was taken. Your task is to identify and classify all these entities correctly.

The output format is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two elements: the entity and its corresponding class. For example, the entity "Jovem" (young man) should be classified as "Person", and the location "Amadora" should be classified as "Location". The class "Nature" should be used for entities that describe the type of event or situation, such as "crime" in this case. The class "Facility" should be used for entities that are places or buildings, such as the hospital where the victim was taken. The class "Organization" should be used for entities that are groups or institutions, such as the police forces involved.

Note that the output format is a JSON-parseable list, which means that the list elements should be surrounded by square brackets and the inner lists should be surrounded by curly braces. The output should be a single list containing all the entity-class pairs, with each pair separated by a comma.
