Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person or group of people.
* Organization: A company, institution, or organization.
* Object: A physical object or entity.
* Location: A place or location.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a tree, animal, or mountain.
* Facility: A man-made structure or facility, such as a building, road, or bridge.
* Other: Any entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a list of entities, where each entity is represented as a list with two elements: the entity itself, and its corresponding class. The entities should be extracted from the input text, and the classes should be assigned based on their context and meaning in the text.
