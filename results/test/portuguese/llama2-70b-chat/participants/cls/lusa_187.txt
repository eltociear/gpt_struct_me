Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and a different set of classes. As before, your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the given text.

The classes in this task are:

* Person: A person or group of people.
* Organization: A company, institution, or organization.
* Object: A physical object or entity.
* Location: A place or location.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a mountain, river, or animal.
* Facility: A building or structure, such as a hospital, school, or stadium.
* Other: Any entity that doesn't fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, if the input text is "John Smith is the CEO of XYZ Corporation", the output would be:
[
["John Smith", "Person"],
["XYZ Corporation", "Organization"]
]

Note that the input text is in Portuguese, so you may need to use a Portuguese language model or dictionary to accurately classify the entities.
