Note:
The output is a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class. The classes are the ones you defined.

This task is a classification task, where you need to classify each entity in the text into one of the predefined classes.

You can use Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques to identify the entities in the text.

You can use a machine learning model, such as a Support Vector Machine (SVM) or a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to classify the entities.

You can also use a rule-based approach, where you define rules to classify the entities based on their part-of-speech tags, named entity types, or other features.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the entity and its corresponding class.
