Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each participant in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person or individual.
* Organization: A group or organization.
* Object: A physical object or entity.
* Location: A place or location.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a tree or animal.
* Facility: A man-made structure or facility.
* Other: Any other entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, in the given input text, "Homem" (man) should be classified as "Person", "Felgueiras" (a location) should be classified as "Location", and "árvore" (tree) should be classified as "Object".
