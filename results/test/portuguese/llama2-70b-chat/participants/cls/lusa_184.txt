Note:
The output format is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two elements: the entity mentioned in the text, and its corresponding class.

In this task, we are given a piece of news in Portuguese and are asked to extract and classify all participants mentioned in the text. The participants can be people, organizations, objects, locations, natures, facilities, or other entities. Our output should be a JSON-parseable list of lists, where each inner list contains two elements: the entity and its corresponding class.

The input text is about a man who died after falling from a roof while working in Famalicão. The text mentions several entities, including the man, the location of the accident (Famalicão and Jesufrei), the organization that reported the incident (Comando Distrital de Operações de Socorro de Braga), the facility that was mobilized to help (VMER), and the GNR (National Republican Guard) that took control of the situation.

The output for this task would be:
[
["Homem", "Person"],
["Famalicão", "Location"],
["Jesufrei", "Location"],
["Vila Nova de Famalicão", "Location"],
["Comando Distrital de Operações de Socorro de Braga", "Organization"],
["Braga", "Location"],
["VMER", "Facility"],
["GNR", "Organization"]
]

It's worth noting that the output format is a list of lists, where each inner list contains two elements: the entity mentioned in the text, and its corresponding class. The classes are defined in the task description, and we can see that the entity "VMER" is classified as a "Facility", for example.
