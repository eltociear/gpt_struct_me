This task is a classic example of named entity recognition and classification. The entities in the text can be classified into different categories, such as person, location, organization, object, etc. Your task is to write a program that can extract and classify all the entities in the given text.

The input text is in Portuguese, but you don't need to understand the language to solve the task. You can use a library or tool that can perform named entity recognition and classification, or you can write your own algorithm to do it.

The output should be a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class. The classes are the ones you defined.

This task is similar to the ones you'll find in the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group's tutorial on named entity recognition and classification.
