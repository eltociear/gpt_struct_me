This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person or group of people.
* Organization: A company, institution, or organization.
* Object: A physical object or a concept.
* Location: A place or location.
* Nature: A natural phenomenon or a concept related to nature.
* Facility: A building, structure, or equipment.
* Other: Any entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

In this task, the input text is in Portuguese, and the entities should be classified accordingly. For example, "Polícia Judiciária" should be classified as "Organization", and "homem" should be classified as "Person".
