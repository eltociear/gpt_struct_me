Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and classes. Your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the text, which can be a person, organization, object, location, nature, facility, or other. The output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings, the first being the entity and the second being the class.

The input text is in Portuguese, so you may need to use a Portuguese language model or dictionary to accurately classify the entities.

Here's a sample output for this task:

[
["GNR", "Organization"],
["Guarda", "Organization"],
["Felgueiras", "Location"],
["Porto", "Location"],
["mulher", "Person"],
["homem", "Person"],
["caçadeira", "Object"],
["pistola", "Object"],
["armas de ar comprimido", "Object"],
["coldre", "Object"],
["munições", "Object"],
["Tribunal Judicial de Felgueiras", "Facility"]
]

The output list contains 11 elements, each representing a participant in the text. The first element is ["GNR", "Organization"], indicating that the GNR is an organization. The second element is ["Guarda", "Organization"], which is another name for the GNR, also classified as an organization. The third element is ["Felgueiras", "Location"], indicating that Felgueiras is a location. The fourth element is ["Porto", "Location"], indicating that Porto is also a location. The fifth element is ["mulher", "Person"], indicating that the victim is a person. The sixth element is ["homem", "Person"], indicating that the perpetrator is also a person. The seventh element is ["caçadeira", "Object"], indicating that a caçadeira (shotgun) is an object. The eighth element is ["pistola", "Object"], indicating that a pistol is also an object. The ninth element is ["armas de ar comprimido", "Object"], indicating that air guns are also objects. The tenth element is ["coldre", "Object"], indicating that a holster is an object. The eleventh element is ["munições", "Object"], indicating that ammunition is also an object.
