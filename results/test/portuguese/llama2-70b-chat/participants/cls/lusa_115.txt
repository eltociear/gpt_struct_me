Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each participant in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person, including their name, age, and role.
* Organization: A company, institution, or entity, including its name and role.
* Object: A physical object, including its name and description.
* Location: A geographical location, including its name and description.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a mountain, river, or animal.
* Facility: A man-made structure, such as a building, hospital, or school.
* Other: Any other entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class. For example, ["Homem", "Person"] represents a person named Homem, who is classified as a person.

The input text is in Portuguese, and the task requires identifying and classifying the participants in the text, including their names, ages, roles, and locations. The task also requires identifying the organizations, locations, and facilities mentioned in the text.
