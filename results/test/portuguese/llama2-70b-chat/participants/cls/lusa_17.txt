Note:
The input text is in Portuguese, but the output should be in English.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each participant in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A human being, such as a politician, a journalist, or a citizen.
* Organization: A group or entity that is not a human being, such as a company, a government, or a media outlet.
* Object: A physical object or a concept, such as a book, a car, or a law.
* Location: A geographical location, such as a country, a city, or a building.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a river, a mountain, or a forest.
* Facility: A man-made structure or entity, such as a hospital, a school, or a prison.
* Other: Any entity that does not fit into the above categories, such as an animal, a fictional character, or a abstract concept.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.
