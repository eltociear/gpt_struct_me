Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each participant in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person or individual.
* Organization: A group or organization.
* Object: A physical object or entity.
* Location: A place or location.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a plant or animal.
* Facility: A man-made structure or entity, such as a building or vehicle.
* Other: Any other entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class. For example, ["Agente da polícia", "Person"] means that the entity "Agente da polícia" belongs to the class "Person".

The input text is in Portuguese, and the task is to classify each participant in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are defined in English, but the input text is in Portuguese, so you may need to use a dictionary or other resource to translate the classes into Portuguese.

The output should be a list of classified participants, where each participant is represented as a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class. For example, [["Agente da polícia", "Person"], ["colega", "Person"], ["Maputo", "Location"]] means that the entities "Agente da polícia" and "colega" belong to the class "Person", and the entity "Maputo" belongs to the class "Location".
