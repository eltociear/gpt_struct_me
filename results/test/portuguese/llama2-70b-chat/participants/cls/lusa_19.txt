Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and classes. As before, your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the given text.

The classes in this task are:

* Person: A person, either mentioned by name or described by a pronoun.
* Organization: A group or entity that is not a person, such as a company, government agency, or institution.
* Object: A physical or abstract object that is not a person or organization.
* Location: A place or location that is not a person or organization.
* Nature: A natural phenomenon or a concept that is not a person, organization, object, or location.
* Facility: A building or structure that is not a person, organization, object, or location.
* Other: Any participant that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, in the given input text, "PJ" is a participant that should be classified as "Organization", and "Braga" is a participant that should be classified as "Location".

Note that the input text is in Portuguese, so you may need to use a language model that is capable of processing Portuguese text.
