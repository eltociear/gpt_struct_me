Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each participant in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person, such as a politician, celebrity, or individual.
* Organization: A group or entity that is not a person, such as a company, government agency, or non-profit organization.
* Object: A physical object or entity, such as a building, vehicle, or animal.
* Location: A geographical location, such as a city, country, or landmark.
* Nature: A natural entity or phenomenon, such as a virus, weather event, or natural disaster.
* Facility: A man-made structure or entity, such as a hospital, school, or stadium.
* Other: Any entity or concept that does not fit into the above categories, such as a date, time, or abstract concept.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class. For example, ["António Costa", "Person"] indicates that "António Costa" is a person.
