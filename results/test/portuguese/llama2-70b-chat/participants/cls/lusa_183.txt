Explanation:
The input text describes a situation where a man has been arrested and fitted with an electronic bracelet for threatening and pursuing his ex-partner in Gaia. The text mentions the man's age, criminal record, and the fact that he is prohibited from contacting the victim or approaching her within 800 meters. The text also mentions the GNR (National Republican Guard) and their investigation into domestic violence.

Based on this information, we can extract the following entities and classify them accordingly:

* "Homem" (man) - Person
* "Gaia" - Location
* "Vila Nova de Gaia" - Location
* "GNR" (National Republican Guard) - Organization
* "detido" (arrested person) - Person
* "vítima" (victim) - Person
* "suspeito" (suspect) - Person
* "militares" (soldiers) - Organization
* "investigação" (investigation) - Facility

Note that some entities may have multiple classes associated with them. For example, "GNR" could also be classified as a "Facility" since it is a government agency, but in this context, it is being used as an "Organization" since it is referred to as a whole entity rather than a physical location. Similarly, "investigação" could also be classified as a "Process" or "Event", but in this context, it is being used as a "Facility" since it refers to the act of investigating rather than a physical location or a specific event.
