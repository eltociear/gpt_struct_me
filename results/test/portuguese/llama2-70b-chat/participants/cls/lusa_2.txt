Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and classes. As before, your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the given text.

The classes in this task are:

* Person: A person or group of people, including their names, ages, genders, etc.
* Organization: A company, institution, government agency, etc.
* Object: A physical object or entity, such as a weapon, vehicle, building, etc.
* Location: A geographical location, such as a city, street, park, etc.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a mountain, river, forest, etc.
* Facility: A man-made structure or entity, such as a hospital, school, restaurant, etc.
* Other: Any entity that doesn't fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, if the input text is "John Smith, a 35-year-old man, was shot dead in the street", the output would be:
[
["John Smith", "Person"],
["35-year-old man", "Person"],
["shot dead", "Nature"],
["street", "Location"]
]

Note that the same entity can have multiple classes. For example, in the previous example, "John Smith" is both a Person and a Victim (a subclass of Person).
