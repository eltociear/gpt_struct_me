Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and classes. As before, your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the given text.

The classes in this task are:

* Person: A person, including names of individuals.
* Organization: A company, institution, or other organization.
* Object: A tangible object or entity.
* Location: A geographical location, including cities, countries, and regions.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a mountain, river, or animal.
* Facility: A man-made structure or entity, such as a building, hospital, or park.
* Other: Any other entity that doesn't fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

The input text is in Portuguese, so make sure to use the appropriate language model for this task.
