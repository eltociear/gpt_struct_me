Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and classes. As before, your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the given text.

The classes in this task are:

* Person: A person or group of people, including their roles, titles, or positions.
* Organization: A company, institution, or entity, including government agencies, schools, hospitals, etc.
* Object: A physical object, including weapons, vehicles, electronics, etc.
* Location: A place or location, including cities, streets, buildings, etc.
* Nature: A natural substance, including drugs, plants, animals, etc.
* Facility: A building or structure, including hospitals, schools, prisons, etc.
* Other: Any other entity that doesn't fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, if the input text is "The man with the hat is holding a gun.", the output would be:
[
["man", "Person"],
["hat", "Object"],
["gun", "Object"]
]

Note that in this task, the input text is in Portuguese, so you may need to use Portuguese language models or resources to perform the task accurately.
