* "Homem" is a person, so it belongs to the "Person" class.
* "rio Tua" is a location, so it belongs to the "Location" class.
* "Mirandela" is a location, so it belongs to the "Location" class.
* "Valverde da Gestosa" is a location, so it belongs to the "Location" class.
* "GNR" is an organization, so it belongs to the "Organization" class.
* "Lusa" is an organization, so it belongs to the "Organization" class.

Note that some entities may belong to more than one class. For example, "rio Tua" could also be classified as "Nature" since it's a river, but in this case, it's being classified as "Location" since it's being used as a location.
