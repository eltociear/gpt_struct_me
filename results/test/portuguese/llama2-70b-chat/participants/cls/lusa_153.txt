Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person, such as a suspect, victim, or witness.
* Organization: A group or organization, such as the GNR or NIAVE.
* Location: A physical location, such as a city, town, or building.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a mountain, river, or forest.
* Facility: A man-made structure, such as a prison, hospital, or school.
* Other: Any entity that does not fit into one of the above categories, such as a substance (e.g. alcohol) or a concept (e.g. problems psiquiátricos).

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class. For example, ["Homem da Trofa", "Person"] indicates that the entity "Homem da Trofa" belongs to the class "Person".
