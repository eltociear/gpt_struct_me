Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify the entities in the text into predefined categories. The categories are:

* Person: A person or group of people.
* Organization: A company, institution, or organization.
* Object: A physical object or entity.
* Location: A place or location.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a plant or animal.
* Facility: A man-made structure or entity, such as a building or vehicle.
* Other: Any entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a list of pairs, where each pair consists of an entity and its corresponding category. The entities should be extracted from the input text, and the categories should be assigned based on the context and meaning of the entity.

For example, in the input text, "Homem" (man) should be classified as "Person", "Guarda Nacional Republicana" (National Republican Guard) should be classified as "Organization", "Óbidos" (a town in Portugal) should be classified as "Location", and so on.

The task requires a good understanding of the context and meaning of the entities in the text, as well as the ability to classify them into the appropriate categories. It also requires the ability to handle ambiguity, as some entities may fit into multiple categories.
