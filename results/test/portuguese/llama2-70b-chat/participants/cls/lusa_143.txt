Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and classes. Your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the text, using the given classes.

You can use the same approach as before, by creating a list of all participants and then classifying them according to their type. You can also use regular expressions to extract the participants and their classes.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

The classes in this task are:

* Person
* Organization
* Object
* Location
* Nature
* Facility
* Other

You can use the same regular expressions as before to extract the participants and their classes.

Here's an example of how you can approach this task:

1. Create a list of all participants in the text.
2. Classify each participant according to its type, using the given classes.
3. Create a JSON-parseable list with the participants and their classes.

The input text is in Portuguese, so you may need to use Portuguese language resources to extract the participants and their classes.

Once you have completed the task, you can submit your answer and see how it compares to the reference solution.
