Note:
The input text is in Portuguese, but the output should be in English.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and a different set of classes. As before, your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the given text.

The classes in this task are:

* Person: A person or group of people, including their roles, titles, and descriptions.
* Organization: A company, institution, or group that is involved in the text.
* Object: A physical object or entity that is mentioned in the text.
* Location: A place or location that is mentioned in the text.
* Nature: A natural entity or phenomenon that is mentioned in the text.
* Facility: A building, structure, or other man-made entity that is mentioned in the text.
* Other: Any entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second string is the class.

For example, in the given input text, "Automóvel" would be classified as "Object", and "Black Lives Matter" would be classified as "Organization".

Note that the input text is in Portuguese, but the output should be in English.
