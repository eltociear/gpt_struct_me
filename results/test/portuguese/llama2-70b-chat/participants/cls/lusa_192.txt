Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and classes. Your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the given text.

The classes in this task are:

* Person: A person, such as a human being, a group of people, or a deity.
* Organization: A group of people or an entity that is involved in an activity or event, such as a company, government agency, or sports team.
* Object: A physical or abstract object, such as a book, car, or idea.
* Location: A place, such as a city, country, or building.
* Nature: A natural phenomenon, such as a storm, earthquake, or animal.
* Facility: A place or structure that serves a specific purpose, such as a hospital, school, or prison.
* Other: Any participant that does not fit into the above categories, such as a concept, a date, or a time.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, in the input text, "Tribunal de Viana do Castelo" is a participant that should be classified as "Organization", and "homem" should be classified as "Person".

The classes are not mutually exclusive, and a participant can belong to multiple classes. For example, "arguido" can be classified as both "Person" and "Facility", since it refers to a person who is in prison.

The task is to extract and classify all participants in the given text, and output them in the format specified above.
