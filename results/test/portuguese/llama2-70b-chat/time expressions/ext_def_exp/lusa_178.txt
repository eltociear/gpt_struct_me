["hoje", "19:23", "30 nov 2020"]

Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

Hint:
You can use the following code to extract temporal expressions:

import re

temporal_expressions = re.findall(r"(\d{1,2}[/ ]?[a-zA-Z]{3,9})", text)

This code uses regular expressions to find all sequences of one to two digits, followed by a space or slash, and then three to nine letters (to match expressions such as "1.100" or "30 nov").

You can then use a list comprehension to convert the matches to a list of strings:

temporal_expressions = [match.group() for match in re.finditer(r"(\d{1,2}[/ ]?[a-zA-Z]{3,9})", text)]

You can also use other libraries such as spaCy or NLTK to perform this task.
