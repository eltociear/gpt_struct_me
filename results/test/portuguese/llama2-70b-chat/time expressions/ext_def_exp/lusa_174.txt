Note:
The input text may contain other temporal expressions that are not explicitly mentioned in the example, such as "hoje", "ontem", "antes", "depois", "agora", "em breve", "em seguida", "em pouco tempo", "em algum momento", "em algum lugar", etc.

The output should be a list of all temporal expressions found in the input text, in the format of a JSON-parseable list of strings.

The temporal expressions can be in any language, but the output should always be in Portuguese.

The input text may contain other linguistic elements that are not temporal expressions, such as names, locations, organizations, etc. These elements should be ignored and not included in the output.

The output should only include temporal expressions that are relevant to the context of the input text, and not any irrelevant temporal expressions that may be present in the text.

The temporal expressions should be extracted in a way that allows them to be easily identifiable and understandable by a human reader.

The output should be a list of strings, with each string representing a single temporal expression.

The order of the temporal expressions in the output list should not matter.

The output should not include any duplicates, meaning that each temporal expression should only appear once in the list.

The output should be in a format that can be easily processed and analyzed by a machine learning algorithm.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list of strings, meaning that it should be a list of strings that can be easily parsed and interpreted by a JSON parser.

The output should be a list of strings that can be easily understood and interpreted by a human reader.
