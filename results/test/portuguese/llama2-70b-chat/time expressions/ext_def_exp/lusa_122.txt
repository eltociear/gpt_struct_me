Note:

* The input text may contain other temporal expressions that are not explicitly mentioned in the example, such as "hoje", "ontem", "amanh√£", "agora", etc.
* The output format is a JSON-parseable list of strings, which means that the strings should be separated by commas and wrapped in square brackets, like this: ["string1", "string2", "string3"].
* The task is to extract all temporal expressions from the input text, regardless of their format or language.
* The input text may contain irrelevant information or noise, so the algorithm should be able to handle such cases and only extract the relevant temporal expressions.
* The output should only contain the temporal expressions that are relevant to the task, and not any other information that may be present in the input text.
