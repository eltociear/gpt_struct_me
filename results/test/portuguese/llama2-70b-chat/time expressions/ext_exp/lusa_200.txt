["hoje", "cerca das 17:55", "30 nov 2020"]

Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

Hint:
You can use the following code to extract dates in the format "day month year" (e.g. "30 nov 2020"):

import re

dates = re.findall(r"\b(\d{1,2}/\w{3}/\d{4})\b", text)

This code uses regular expressions to find all sequences of one to two digits, followed by a forward slash, three letters (representing the month), another forward slash, and four digits (representing the year). The \b characters match word boundaries, ensuring that we only match complete dates.

You can then convert these dates to a JSON-parseable list of strings using the list comprehension:

dates_json = [date.strip() for date in dates]

This will produce a list of strings in the format "30 nov 2020".

You can use a similar approach to extract other time expressions, such as "hoje" (today) and "cerca das 17:55" (around 5:55 PM).
