["hoje", "hoje", "19:23"]

Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

Hint:
You can use the following code to extract time expressions:

import re

time_expressions = re.findall(r'\b(hoje|sábado|domingo|terça|quarta|quinta|sexta|sétima|mês|ano|semana|dia|noite|manhã|tarde|vespera|madrugada)\b', text)

This code uses regular expressions to find all words that match the time expressions.
The \b word boundary is used to ensure that the time expressions are matched as whole words, and not parts of other words.
The re.findall function returns a list of all matches.
You can then use this list to extract the time expressions from the text.

Note that this code will match all time expressions in the text, regardless of whether they are in the past, present, or future tense.
If you only want to extract time expressions in a specific tense, you can modify the regular expression accordingly.
For example, to extract only time expressions in the past tense, you can use the following regular expression:

r'\b(sábado|domingo|terça|quarta|quinta|sexta|sétima|mês|ano|semana|dia|noite|manhã|tarde|vespera|madrugada)\b'

This regular expression will match all time expressions that are in the past tense, while ignoring those in the present or future tense.
