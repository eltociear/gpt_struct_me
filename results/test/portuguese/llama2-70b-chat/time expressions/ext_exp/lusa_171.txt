["16 de maio de 2020", "04:20", "06:00", "2020"]

Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

Hint:
You can use the following code to extract dates in the format "day month year" (e.g. "16 maio 2020"):

import re

dates = re.findall(r"\b(\d{1,2}\s+[a-zA-Z]{3}\s+(\d{4})?)", texto)

This code uses regular expressions to find sequences of one or two digits, followed by a space, then three letters (representing the month), another space, and four digits (representing the year). The \b symbol matches word boundaries, ensuring that we only match complete dates. The ? symbol makes the last four digits optional, allowing us to match dates in the format "day month" (e.g. "16 maio").

You can then convert these dates to a JSON-parseable list of strings using the list comprehension:

dates_json = [date.strip() for date in dates]

This code strips any whitespace characters from each date, resulting in a list of clean dates in the format "16 maio 2020".

You can use a similar approach to extract times in the format "hour:minute" (e.g. "04:20").
