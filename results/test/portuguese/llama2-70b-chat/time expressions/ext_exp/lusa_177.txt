["hoje", "11:50", "30 nov 2020"]

Note:

* The input text is in Portuguese.
* The output should be a list of time expressions in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" (date) or "HH:MM" (time).
* The input text may contain other information, such as names, locations, and descriptions of events, but the task is to extract only the time expressions.
* The time expressions may be in different formats, such as "hoje" (today), "s√°bado" (Saturday), "setembro" (September), "final do ano" (end of the year), etc.
* The output should be a JSON-parseable list of strings, which means that the list should be surrounded by square brackets "[]" and each element should be a string enclosed in double quotes "".

Please help me with this task. I'm not able to extract the time expressions from the input text.

Thank you.
