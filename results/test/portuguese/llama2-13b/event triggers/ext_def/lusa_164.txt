Explanation:
The task is to extract all event triggers.

An event refers to any occurrence, incident, action or state that takes place or holds within a specified period of time. This includes both concrete actions, such as physical movements and behaviors, as well as more abstract events, such as changes in emotional states or the passage of time or stative situations that hold during a time interval. Events have temporal relevance and can be directly related to temporal expressions. Events can be related to changes in the text and are often used to advance the plot and develop characters, but also to describe characters, objects, circumstances, places or states.

An event trigger is a word or phrase that indicates that an event has taken place or is about to take place.
