- The government of the Netherlands approves aid to KLM after pilots accept to reduce salaries
- The government of the Netherlands approved on Tuesday a rescue plan for the airline KLM, in the order of several billion euros, after the pilots had accepted a reduction in salaries for five years.
- The finance minister, Wopke Hoekstra, had frozen aid, in the form of loans, to the Dutch branch of Air France-KLM, in the face of the refusal of the pilots' union VNV to accept a salary reduction.
- But KLM announced that the union had given in, which led the government to say that it was ready to lend 3.4 billion euros, according to the news agency France-Presse (AFP).
- KLM expects to reduce costs by 15% and eliminate 5,000 jobs.
- About three thousand pilots are expected to be particularly affected by this plan, with salary cuts that can go up to 20%, according to the country's media.
- Air France-KLM lost 1.6 billion euros in the third quarter, which compares with a profit of 363 million in the same quarter last year.
