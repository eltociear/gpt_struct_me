]

Explanation:
The task is to extract all time expressions from the given text. The output should be a JSON-parseable list of strings, where each string represents a time expression.

In this case, there are two time expressions:

* "16:00 locais" (local time)
* "21:00 em Lisboa" (Lisbon time)

Both expressions are in the format of "hour:minute", where "hour" is the hour in 12-hour format and "minute" is the minute.
