"18:14",
"hoje",
"2 horas depois"
]

Explanation:

* 18:14: time of the accident
* hoje: today
* 2 horas depois: 2 hours later

Note:

* The time expressions are in Portuguese, so the output should be in Portuguese as well.
* The output should be a JSON-parseable list of strings, with each string representing a time expression.
