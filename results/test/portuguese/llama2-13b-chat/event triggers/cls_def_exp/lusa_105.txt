The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings: the first string is the entity (e.g. "GNR") and the second string is the class (e.g. "I_Action"). The classes are:

* I_Action: an action or event that is taking place or has taken place
* State: a state or condition that exists or existed at a certain time
* Occurrence: an event or happening that has taken place
* Reporting: a statement or piece of information that is being reported or conveyed
* Aspectual: a state or condition that is true or exists at a certain time, but is not necessarily an action or event
* Intensional Action: an action or event that is intended or planned to take place
* Intensional State: a state or condition that is intended or planned to exist.
