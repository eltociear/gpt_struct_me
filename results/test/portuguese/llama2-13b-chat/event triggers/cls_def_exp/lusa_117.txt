[["acidente", "Occurrence"], ["ferimentos", "Occurrence"], ["graves", "State"], ["condutor", "Entity"], ["transportado", "I_Action"], ["hospital", "Location"], ["viatura", "Entity"], ["despiste", "Occurrence"], ["destroços", "Occurrence"], ["cortada", "State"], ["estrada", "Location"], ["fechadas", "State"], ["óleo", "Occurrence"], ["derramado", "Occurrence"], ["destroços", "Occurrence"], ["manter", "I_Action"], ["atirou-se", "I_Action"], ["ferimentos", "Occurrence"], ["ligeiros", "State"], ["testemunhas", "Entity"], ["oculares", "Entity"]]

Note:
The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings: the first is the entity (e.g. "acidente") and the second is the class (e.g. "Occurrence").

I have tried using the Stanford CoreNLP tool to perform the task, but I am not getting the expected output. I have also tried using the spaCy library, but I am not getting the expected output.

Can you please help me with this task? I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide me with the correct output for the given input.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification.
