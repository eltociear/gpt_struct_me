Please help me with the task of extracting and classifying all event triggers in the given texts.

Note: I have tried using spaCy's entity recognition and coreference resolution, but I am not able to get the desired output.

Also, I have tried using the Stanford CoreNLP, but I am not able to get the desired output.

Please help me with this task.

Thank you.
