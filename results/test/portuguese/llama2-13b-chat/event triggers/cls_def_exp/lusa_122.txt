Note:
The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings: the first string is the entity (e.g. "Alex Apolinário") and the second string is the class label (e.g. "I_Person"). The classes are:

* I_Action: for actions and events that involve an action or a change in state
* I_State: for states and conditions that hold over time
* Occurrence: for events and occurrences that happen at a specific time or during a specific period
* Reporting: for information that is reported or described in the text
* Aspectual: for aspects or properties of entities or events that are described in the text
* Intensional Action: for actions and events that have a specific goal or intention
* Intensional State: for states and conditions that have a specific goal or intention

Your task is to extract and classify all event triggers in the input text using the above classes.
