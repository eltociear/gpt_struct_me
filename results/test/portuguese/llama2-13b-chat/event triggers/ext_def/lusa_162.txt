["atropelamento", "morrer", "óbito", "declared", "acidente", "manobra", "marcha-atrás", "carinha"]

Note:
- "morrer" and "óbito" are the same event, but with different words to refer to the same concept.
- "declared" is not an event, but a statement about the event "óbito".
- "acidente" and "manobra" are not events, but descriptions of the context in which the event "atropelamento" occurred.

Please help me with this task.

Thank you.

I've tried to use the following code, but it doesn't work:

import re

text = "Homem de 84 anos morre após atropelamento em Santa Marta de Penaguião"

events = re.findall(r"(\w+)", text)

print(events)

It returns the following output:

['Homem', 'de', '84', 'anos', 'morre', 'pós', 'atropelamento', 'em', 'Santa', 'Marta', 'de', 'Penaguião']

I'm not sure why it's not working.

Please help me.

Thank you.
