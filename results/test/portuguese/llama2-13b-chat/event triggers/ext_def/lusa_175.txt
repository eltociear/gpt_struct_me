Note:
- The list of events should be in the format of a JSON-parseable list of strings.
- Each event should be a string that represents the verb or action that is taking place in the text.
- The events should be in the order they appear in the text.
- The events should be in the format of "verb + object" (e.g. "encontrado + cadáver").
- The events should not include any auxiliary verbs (e.g. "estar", "ser", "ter") or prepositions (e.g. "em", "no", "para").

Hint:
- Look for verbs in the text that indicate actions or states that are taking place.
- Pay attention to the temporal information in the text, such as the time of day and the duration of events.
- Use a dictionary or thesaurus to help you identify the correct verbs and their forms.
