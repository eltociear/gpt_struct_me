Explanation:
The task is to extract all event triggers from the given text. An event trigger is a word or phrase that indicates the occurrence of an event. In this text, the event triggers are:

* "maltratar" (to mistreat)
* "ameaçar de morte" (to threaten with death)
* "violência doméstica" (domestic violence)
* "infligir maus-tratos físicos e psicológicos" (to inflict physical and psychological mistreatment)

These event triggers are extracted from the text using a combination of part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition. The output is a JSON-parseable list of strings, where each string represents an event trigger.
