Explanation:

* MP is an organization, so it is classified as such.
* Homem is a person, so it is classified as such.
* Filha da companheira is also a person, so it is classified as such.
* Braga and Amares are locations, so they are classified as such.
* 2016, 2017, and 2019 are years, so they are classified as such.
* Trato sexual is an object, so it is classified as such.

Note:

* In this example, all the entities are classified as either persons, locations, objects, or years.
* The classes are represented as strings, but in a real-world application, you might want to use more specific classes or types.
* The output is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the entity and the class.
