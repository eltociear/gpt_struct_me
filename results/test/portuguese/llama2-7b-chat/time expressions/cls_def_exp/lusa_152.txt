Explanation:

In this task, we were given two inputs: the first one is a news article about an incident in Angola, and the second one is a list of time expressions found in the article. Our task is to extract and classify all time expressions found in the article.
We extracted 8 time expressions from the article:

* "em menos de uma semana" (Duration)
* "sábado" (Date)
* "sábado" (Date)
* "setembro" (Time)
* "final do ano" (Time)
* "menos de uma semana" (Duration)
* "30 nov 2020" (Date)
* "época de veda" (Time)
* "épocas de veda" (Time)

We classified each time expression according to its type:

* "em menos de uma semana" is a Duration expression.
* "sábado" is a Date expression.
* "sábado" is a Date expression.
* "setembro" is a Time expression.
* "final do ano" is a Time expression.
* "menos de uma semana" is a Duration expression.
* "30 nov 2020" is a Date expression.
* "época de veda" is a Time expression.
* "épocas de veda" is a Time expression.

Note that some time expressions may have multiple classifications, depending on how they are used in the text. For example, "em menos de uma semana" can also be classified as a Time expression, since it refers to a specific time period.
