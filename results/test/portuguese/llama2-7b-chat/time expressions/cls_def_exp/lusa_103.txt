[["detido", "Person"], ["matou", "Action"], ["filhos", "Object"], ["mexico", "Location"], ["sunday", "Date"], ["north", "Location"], ["sonora", "Location"], ["hidalgo", "Location"]]

Explanation:

In this task, we are given a text and we need to extract and classify all time expressions found in it. Time expressions are linguistic elements that allow us to communicate information about time, such as dates, times, durations, and sets.
The input text is in Portuguese and it talks about a man who was arrested in Mexico for killing his three sons in a fit of rage against his wife. The text provides us with several time expressions that we need to classify.
The first time expression is "em menos de uma semana", which means "in less than a week" and it belongs to the class "Duration". The second time expression is "sábado", which means "Saturday" and it belongs to the class "Date". The third time expression is also "sábado", which means "Saturday" and it belongs to the class "Date" again. The fourth time expression is "setembro", which means "September" and it belongs to the class "Time". The fifth time expression is "final do ano", which means "end of the year" and it belongs to the class "Time". The sixth time expression is "menos de uma semana", which means "less than a week" and it belongs to the class "Duration". The seventh time expression is "30 nov 2020", which means "November 30, 2020" and it belongs to the class "Date". The eighth time expression is "época de veda", which means "fishing season" and it belongs to the class "Time". The ninth time expression is "épocas de veda", which means "fishing seasons" and it belongs to the class "Time" again.
Therefore, the output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class. In this case, the output list should look like this:
[["detido", "Person"], ["matou", "Action"], ["filhos", "Object"], ["mexico", "Location"], ["sunday", "Date"], ["north", "Location"], ["sonora", "Location"], ["hidalgo", "Location"]]
