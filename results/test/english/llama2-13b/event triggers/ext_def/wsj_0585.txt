  "Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading.",
  "Their motivation, however, has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks.",
  "The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is ",
  " making it tough for traders to make money.",
  "The stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard amp Poor's 500-stock index.",
  "The SampP 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies.",
  "The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it amounted to more than 13% in September.",
  "Estimates from traders put it at less than 5% of Nasdaq's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares.",
  "Other market-maker gripes: Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market.",
  "Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity.",
  "Moreover, the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses them.",
  "Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market.",
  "But the big, often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it.",
  "Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, acknowledges that he wasn't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising.",
  "We weren't as concerned until they became sell programs," says Mr. DaPuzzo, who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility.",
  "Shearson Lehman, however, executes program trades for clients.",
  "Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, in addition to Shearson, say they do so only for customers, however.",
  "Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients' accounts.",
  "Of course, there were sell programs in past years, too, but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days.",
  "That's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash, when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled.",
  "Market makers, to cut costs, slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren't selling.",
  "And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress.",
  "On days when prices are tumbling, they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will.",
  "In such an environment, market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares.",
  "\"It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you're going to lose,\" says Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin.",
  "But this skittishness, Mr. Antolini says, is creating liquidity problems in certain OTC stocks.",
  "\"It's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers don't want to { take the orders}. No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks.\"",
  "Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, agrees that program trading is hurting the market's efforts to bring back small invest
