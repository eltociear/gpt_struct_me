"The U.S. government is considering a plan to send a team of experts to the Philippines to help the government there fight a communist insurgency, a U.S. official said Friday. The plan is being discussed by the U.S. Embassy in Manila and the Philippine government, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said the plan is still in the discussion stage and no decision has been made. The Philippine government has been fighting communist rebels for more than 30 years.
