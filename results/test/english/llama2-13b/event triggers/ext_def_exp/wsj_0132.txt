"The U.S. government said Friday it will not appeal a federal judge's ruling that the government must pay $1.3 million to a man who was wrongly convicted of murder and spent 17 years in prison.
The decision by the Justice Department means that the government will not seek a review of the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit.
The government had argued that it should not have to pay the money because the man, John Thompson, was convicted of a state crime and the federal government was not involved in his prosecution.
Thompson was convicted of murder in 1982 and sentenced to death. He was released in 2003 after DNA tests showed that blood found at the crime scene did not match his.
Thompson sued the government for violating his civil rights.
U.S. District Judge Ginger Berrigan ruled in 2005 that the government was liable for the wrongful conviction.
The government appealed the ruling, but the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the decision in 2006.
