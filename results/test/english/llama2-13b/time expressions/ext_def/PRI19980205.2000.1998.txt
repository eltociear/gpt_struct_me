The task is to extract all time expressions from the input text.

Time expressions are linguistic elements that allow us to communicate information about time. In addition to representing specific points in time, they can also be used to classify time periods according to units such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list of strings.
