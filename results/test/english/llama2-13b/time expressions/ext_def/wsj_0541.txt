Explanation:
The first step is to extract all the words from the input text.

Next, we need to identify the time expressions.

We can do this by looking for words that are followed by a number and a unit of time.

For example, "Nov. 16" is a time expression because it is followed by a number ("16") and a unit of time ("Nov.").

We can then extract all the time expressions from the input text by looking for words that are followed by a number and a unit of time.

Finally, we can output the list of time expressions as a JSON-parseable list of strings.
