"The Persian Gulf showdown between Iraq and the United States took a more personal turn Thursday when Iraq's Saddam Hussein called President Bush a liar and said the outbreak of holy war could bring thousands of Americans home in coffins. Bush, commenting on the two-week gulf crisis from his vacation home in Maine, said he saw little reason to be optimistic about a settlement of the dispute, which stems from Iraq's invasion of oil-wealthy Kuwait and its subsequent military buildup on the border of Saudi Arabia. After a two-hour meeting at his Kennebunkport home with King Hussein of Jordan, Bush said, ``I did not come away with any feeling of hope'' that Iraq would withdraw its army from Kuwait. Bush also said Thursday that King Hussein assured him Jordan would close the last remaining free port to most Iraqi trade as the economic embargo on materials to Iraq continued unabated. Foodstuffs are among the goods being blocked from entry; Iraq imports about three-quarters of its food. Pentagon sources in Washington meanwhile said the Bush administration plans to deploy 45,000 Marines to the region to back up the thousands of Army, Navy and Air Force troops already in place in the gulf and the Saudi desert. At a news conference, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Jordan `` is seeking some guidance'' about a provision in the U.N.-backed trade embargo that allows food for humanitarian purposes. Worries however grew about the safety of Americans and other Westerners trapped in Kuwait. Iraqi military authorities ordered all Americans and Britons in Kuwait to assemble at a hotel, officials said. ``Very few'' of the 2,500 Americans in occupied Kuwait complied with the order, a senior U.S. official told The Associated Press. Iraq said the roundup was to protect them from unspecified threats; British Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave called the order ``grave and sinister.'' ``What we fear is that they will be interned somewhere, most likely in Iraq,'' Waldegrave said. A total of about 3,000 Americans, 3,000 Britons and more than 450 Japanese are in Iraq and Kuwait. Overall, more than 2 million foreigners are in both countries. Iraq has called them ``restrictees.'' In addition to the estimated 45,000 Marines to ultimately be part of Operation Desert Shield, Stealth fighter planes and the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy are also headed to Saudi Arabia to protect it from Iraqi expansionism. In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Iraq has continued to increase its armed forces in Kuwait and they now number about 160,000. Saddam has been under international quarantine since his Aug. 2 power-grab, or what he calls an ``eternal merger'' with Kuwait. In a long verbal attack read on Iraqi television Thursday, Saddam repeatedly called Bush ``a liar'' and said a shooting war could produce body bags courtesy of Baghdad. ``We continue to pray and pray hard to God so that there will be no confrontation whereby you will receive thousands of Americans wrapped in sad coffins after you had pushed them into a dark tunnel,'' Saddam said. He called U.S. soldiers massing in Saudi Arabia the real occupiers in the Persian Gulf. Replied State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher, ``We haven't really analyzed the statement in detail but it appears to be just another example of his outlandish rhetoric and his attempts to distort the truth. ``We believe that his words cannot distract the world from the facts of Iraqi aggression.'' An international land, sea and air force has mobilized since Iraq's invasion, which was sparked by disputes over oil, land and repayment of war loans. In the largest U.S. military operation since Vietnam, an estimated 20,000 American GIs have already massed to defend Saudi Arabia. ``We don't just arrive,'' said four-star Gen. John Dailey, assistant commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps. ``We're there to stay for a fairly lengthy period.'' Egypt, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh also committed ground troops, to a
