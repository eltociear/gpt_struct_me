""So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success," said a buoyant Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces. Similarly, while cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that "the operation has been very successful." Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a week. But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S. The allied rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms. But it has offended some, especially in Arab countries, who now believe that Mr. Bush's real objectives are the demise of Saddam Hussein and the destruction of the Iraqi military, not just the liberation of Kuwait. "Why have a war?" asked Abdul Latif Shekar, a customs officer in Egypt, a country participating in the attack on Iraqi troops. "I think the Gorbachev plan was a good one. Iraq was ready to withdraw." Now, he says, "it looks like the West just wants to destroy Iraq." Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still suffer greater casualties and become bogged down militarily, especially when they encounter the tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched along the Iraq-Kuwait border. If so, and if it appears that the American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, "the lingering cost of that could be high," worries former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. But, he notes, "If everything crumbles totally, that won't be such a problem." American officials staunchly disavow any interest in driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit of Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled government inside Iraq. The Americans say their battle plans call for operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say there isn't any plan to drive beyond that. Indeed, French President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi territory as part of a "pincer" movement to trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but insisted, "The purpose isn't to invade Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate." Nevertheless, American officials over the weekend became more open in declaring that by destroying Saddam Hussein's military machine they hope to destroy his regime -- a goal likely to be supported by most Americans. In a pre-attack message, Lt. Gen. Walter Boomer, the top Marine in the Persian Gulf, told U.S. Marines that their goal is to " restore {Kuwait} to its citizens." He went on to add that "in so doing you not only return a nation to its people, but you will destroy the war machine of a ruthless dictator." Secretary of State James Baker said on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley" that the series of United Nations resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait "imply that the restoration of peace and stability in the Gulf would be a heck of a lot easier if he and that leadership were not in power in Iraq." Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for allied forces as it appears to have been so far. Iraq still has the potential to cause significant problems by using forces and weapons that don't yet seem fully engaged. For one thing, Iraq still apparently hasn't unleashed its stockpile of chemical weapons. Gen. Schwarzkopf said that some early reports that chemical weapons were used against allied troops turned out to be "bogus." Iraq is believed to have the ability to deliver chemical weapons in artillery shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles. Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense. It remains to be seen how
