Earlier AT and T also announced an eighteen percent drop in profits for the fourth quarter. The company's sales force applauded the shake up.
It's not something we're not used to in the industry. But I think right now, for AT and T and the people here, it's fairly intense as you might w- well imagine.

Explanation:
The task is to extract all time expressions from the input text.

Time expressions are linguistic elements that allow us to communicate information about time. In addition to representing specific points in time, they can also be used to classify time periods according to units such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list of strings.
