Note:
The classes are not mutually exclusive, and an event can belong to multiple classes.

This task is to extract and classify all event triggers in a given text. Event triggers are the words or phrases that indicate the occurrence of an event.

The classes are:

1. State: Indicates a state of being or a situation.
Example: "The Pentagon said today it will re-examine the question."
2. Occurrence: Indicates an event or happening.
Example: "CBS News first reported last night that the tomb may contain the remains of Air Force pilot Michael Blassie."
3. Reporting: Indicates a report or statement about an event.
Example: "The Pentagon said today it will re-examine the question."
4. Perception: Indicates a perception or belief about an event.
Example: "There was a suspicion the body was Blassie because his uniform and ID card were found near the body in Vietnam."
5. Aspectual: Indicates a possibility or potential event.
Example: "But subsequently, they were lost."
6. Intensional Action: Indicates an action that is intended or planned.
Example: "Blassie's mother now wants the remains in the tomb tested for DNA."
7. Intensional State: Indicates a state that is intended or planned.
Example: "The Pentagon said today it will re-examine the question."

The output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.
