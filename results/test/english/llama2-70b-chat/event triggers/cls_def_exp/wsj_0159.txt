Please ensure that your model can handle the following:

* Events can be described using different verbs (e.g., "extended", "launched", "said")
* Events can have different arguments (e.g., "DD Acquisition Corp." vs. "Dunkin' Donuts Inc.")
* Events can have different temporal references (e.g., "yesterday" vs. "Nov. 10")
* Events can have different aspects (e.g., "offer" vs. "lawsuit")
* Events can have different intensities (e.g., "extended" vs. "launched")
* Events can have different certainty (e.g., "said" vs. "set")
* Events can have different sources (e.g., "DD Acquisition Corp." vs. "Dunkin' Donuts Inc.")

Please provide a model that can classify events into the following categories:

* OCCURRENCE: Refers to any occurrence, incident, action, or state that takes place or holds within a specified period of time.
* STATE: Refers to a state of being or a condition.
* REPORTING: Refers to the act of reporting or describing an event.
* PERCEPTION: Refers to the act of perceiving or interpreting an event.
* ASPECTUAL: Refers to the aspect or phase of an event.
* INTENSIONAL ACTION: Refers to an action that is intended or planned.
* INTENSIONAL STATE: Refers to a state that is intended or planned.

Please provide a model that can classify events into these categories using a machine learning algorithm.
