Note:
The classifier should be able to handle different types of events, such as:

* State: describes a situation or condition
* Occurrence: describes an event or happening
* Reporting: describes the act of reporting or stating something
* Perception: describes a person's perception or view of something
* Aspectual: describes a situation or event in terms of its aspects or features
* Intensional Action: describes an action or activity that is intended or planned
* Intensional State: describes a state or condition that is intended or planned

Also, the classifier should be able to handle different types of event triggers, such as:

* Time-based triggers: triggers that are based on a specific time or time period
* Event-based triggers: triggers that are based on a specific event or occurrence
* User-based triggers: triggers that are based on user input or action
* System-based triggers: triggers that are based on system-level events or conditions

The classifier should be able to accurately classify event triggers into their respective categories, and should be able to handle a wide range of event triggers and types.
