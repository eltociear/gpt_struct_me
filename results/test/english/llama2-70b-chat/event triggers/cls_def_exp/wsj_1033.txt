Note:
The class labels are not exhaustive, and some instances may belong to more than one class.

This task is similar to the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group's (SNLPG) task, "Event Argument Extraction" (EAE), which was a part of the GLUE benchmark.

This task is a simplified version of the EAE task, where the goal is to extract and classify all event triggers in a given text. The event triggers are the words or phrases that indicate the occurrence of an event.

The classes used in this task are based on the ones used in the EAE task and are as follows:

* State: Indicates the state of the entity, such as "is," "are," "am," "be," etc.
* Occurrence: Indicates the occurrence of an event, such as "happened," "occurred," "took place," etc.
* Reporting: Indicates the reporting of an event, such as "said," "reported," "announced," etc.
* Perception: Indicates the perception of an event, such as "seemed," "appeared," "looked," etc.
* Aspectual: Indicates the aspectual nature of an event, such as "began," "started," "continued," etc.
* Intensional Action: Indicates the intention or purpose behind an event, such as "intended," "planned," "aimed," etc.
* Intensional State: Indicates the state of an entity's intention or purpose, such as "wanted," "hoped," "expected," etc.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, the output for the input text "Esselte AB, the Stockholm office supplies company, as expected, proposed to acquire the 22% it doesn't own of its U.S. unit, Esselte Business Systems Inc." would be:

[
["Esselte AB", "OCCURRENCE"],
["Esselte Business Systems Inc", "OCCURRENCE"],
["as expected", "PERCEPTION"],
["proposed", "INTENTIONAL ACTION"],
["to acquire", "INTENTIONAL ACTION"],
["the 22%", "OCCURRENCE"],
["it doesn't own", "OCCURRENCE"],
["of its U.S. unit", "OCCURRENCE"],
["Esselte Business Systems Inc", "OCCURRENCE"]
]

Note that some instances may belong to more than one class.
