Note:
The classes are not mutually exclusive, and entities can belong to multiple classes.

This task is an extraction task. Given a piece of text, your goal is to extract and classify all event triggers. Event triggers are words or phrases that indicate a specific event or action is taking place.

For example, in the sentence "The company will launch a new product next month", "launch" is an event trigger indicating the event of introducing a new product.

Your output should be a list of event triggers, each with its corresponding class (such as "I_ACTION", "OCCURRENCE", etc.).

Note that some event triggers may belong to multiple classes. For example, "launch" could also be classified as "I_ACTION" and "OCCURRENCE".

You can use the provided training data to train your model. The training data consists of a list of event triggers and their corresponding classes.

Once you have trained your model, you can use it to classify event triggers in new text. You can then use the classified event triggers to extract and analyze the events described in the text.

This task is useful in various applications such as information retrieval, text summarization, and event extraction.

Here are some examples of event triggers and their corresponding classes:

* "launch" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "announced" (REPORTING, OCCURRENCE)
* "plans" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "introduce" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "release" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "unveil" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "start" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "begin" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "continue" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "conclude" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "finish" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "end" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "cancel" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "postpone" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "reschedule" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "call off" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "put off" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "delay" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "accelerate" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "speed up" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "hasten" (I_ACTION, OCCURRENCE)
* "expedite" (I_ACTION
