Please ensure that your model can extract and classify all event triggers in the given text. Event triggers are the words or phrases that indicate the occurrence of an event. For example, in the sentence "The offensive is progressing with dramatic success," the event trigger is "progressing."

Please use the classes provided in the task description to classify the event triggers.

Please note that the input text may contain multiple event triggers, and some event triggers may belong to multiple classes.

Please ensure that your model can handle ambiguity in the input text. For example, the word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the side of a river. Your model should be able to disambiguate such words and classify them correctly.

Please submit your model as a JSON-parseable list of event triggers, along with their corresponding classes. The format of the output should be the same as the one provided in the task description.

Please note that the evaluation metric for this task will be the F1 score, which measures the accuracy of the model in classifying event triggers. The F1 score will be calculated based on the precision and recall of the model.

Please ensure that your model is trained on a diverse dataset that includes a variety of event triggers and classes. This will help to improve the accuracy and generalization of your model.

Please submit your model as a JSON-parseable list of event triggers, along with their corresponding classes. The format of the output should be the same as the one provided in the task description.

I'm looking forward to seeing your model!
