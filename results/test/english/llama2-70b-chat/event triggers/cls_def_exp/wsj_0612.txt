Please ensure that your model can extract and classify all event triggers in the given text. Event triggers are words or phrases that indicate a specific event or action is taking place, such as "said," "announced," "declared," "launched," "started," "ended," etc.

Please also ensure that your model can distinguish between different types of events, such as state, occurrence, reporting, perception, aspectual, intensional action, and intensional state.

For example, in the given text, "said" is an event trigger that indicates a reporting event, while "launched" is an event trigger that indicates an occurrence event. Similarly, "started" is an event trigger that indicates an occurrence event, while "ended" is an event trigger that indicates a state event.

Please note that the given text is just an example, and your model should be able to extract and classify event triggers from any text that contains them.

Also, please ensure that your model can handle ambiguity in the text, such as when a word or phrase can be classified under more than one event category. For example, "break" can be classified under both occurrence and state events, depending on the context in which it is used.

Please ensure that your model is robust and can handle variations in language, such as different verb tenses, synonyms, and idiomatic expressions.

Finally, please provide a detailed explanation of your model, including the algorithms and techniques used, and any preprocessing steps that were necessary to prepare the text data for analysis.
