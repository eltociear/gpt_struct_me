Note:
The class of an entity is not always straightforward. For example, "Savin Corp." could also be classified as a "COMPANY" or "BUSINESS".

Please ensure that your code can handle the following:

* Entities and classes may contain punctuation.
* Entities and classes may contain multiple words.
* Some entities may have multiple classes.
* Some classes may have multiple entities.
* The input text may contain irrelevant information.
* The input text may contain misspellings or typos.

Your task is to write a program that takes the input text and outputs the list of entities and their corresponding classes in the format specified above.

Note:
This is a sample task. The actual task may have different requirements and/or different input text.
