Please ensure that your model can handle the above input and output format.

Task Description:
Your task is to train a machine learning model that can classify event triggers in text into the following classes:

1. State: Represents a state of being or a condition.
Example: "The company's financial health is in a state of crisis."
2. Occurrence: Represents an event or happening.
Example: "The company's annual meeting is scheduled to occur next week."
3. Reporting: Represents a report or statement about an event or situation.
Example: "The company's quarterly earnings report showed a significant increase in profits."
4. Perception: Represents a person's perspective or viewpoint on an event or situation.
Example: "The company's new product launch was perceived as a huge success."
5. Aspectual: Represents a change or development in a situation.
Example: "The company's stock price has been steadily increasing over the past year."
6. Intensional Action: Represents an action or activity that is intended or planned.
Example: "The company intends to launch a new marketing campaign next month."
7. Intensional State: Represents a state or condition that is intended or planned.
Example: "The company's goal is to increase its market share to 20% within the next year."

Your model should be able to classify event triggers in text into these seven classes. You can use any machine learning algorithm or combination of algorithms that you prefer.

Evaluation Metrics:
Your model will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

1. Precision: The number of true positives (correctly classified event triggers) divided by the total number of positive predictions (both true positives and false positives).
2. Recall: The number of true positives divided by the total number of actual positive instances (both true positives and false negatives).
3. F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

You can use any evaluation dataset that you prefer, as long as it contains a sufficient number of labeled event triggers that can be used to train and evaluate your model. You can also use any preprocessing techniques or feature extraction methods that you prefer to prepare the data for training.

Please submit your trained model as a Python pickle file, along with a brief description of the algorithm or algorithms you used and any preprocessing techniques or feature extraction methods you applied. Please also include a prediction for the test input provided above.
