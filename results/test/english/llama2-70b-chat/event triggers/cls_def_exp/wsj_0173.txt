Note:
The output format is a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.

Please ensure that your code can handle the following cases:

* Multiple entities and classes in a single sentence
* Multiple sentences
* Different types of entities (e.g., organizations, people, locations)
* Different types of classes (e.g., OCCURRENCE, STATE)

Your task is to extract and classify all event triggers in the given text. Event triggers are words or phrases that indicate a change in state, occurrence, or action. They can be verbs, nouns, adjectives, or adverbs.

For example, in the sentence "The company's stock peaked at $65 a share in the early 1980s," the event trigger is "peaked," which indicates a change in the state of the company's stock.

In the sentence "The Avon, Conn., company's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer," the event trigger is "hit a high," which indicates a change in the state of the company's stock.

In the sentence "But Coleco bounced back with the introduction of the Cabbage Patch dolls, whose sales hit $600 million in 1985," the event trigger is "bounced back," which indicates a change in the state of the company's fortunes.

In the sentence "But as the craze died, Coleco failed to come up with another winner and filed for bankruptcy-law protection in July 1988," the event trigger is "failed," which indicates a change in the state of the company's ability to come up with a successful product.

Your output should be a list of event triggers, with each trigger classified into one of the following categories:

* OCCURRENCE: Indicates a change in state or occurrence.
* STATE: Indicates a state or condition.
* ACTION: Indicates an action or activity.
* PERCEPTION: Indicates a perception, opinion, or belief.
* INTENSIONAL ACTION: Indicates an intended action or plan.
* INTENSIONAL STATE: Indicates an intended state or condition.

For example, the event triggers in the sentence "The company's stock peaked at $65 a share in the early 1980s" would be:

* "peaked" (OCCURRENCE)
* "at $65 a share" (OCCURRENCE)
* "in the early 1980s" (STATE)

The event triggers in the sentence "The Avon, Conn., company's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer" would be:

* "hit a high" (
