Input:
"The U.S. government has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the American Indian Movement over the 1973 shootout at Wounded Knee, S.D., in which two Indians were killed.
The settlement, announced Tuesday, ends a 10-year-old lawsuit that had been scheduled to go to trial in October.
The government had argued that the suit was barred by the 1976 Indian Claims Commission Act, which limited the amount of damages that could be awarded to $200,000.
The government also argued that the suit was barred by the 1978 Civil Liberties Act, which provided $1.3 billion in compensation to Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II.
The government said it settled the suit to avoid the expense of a trial and to avoid the possibility of a jury awarding more than the $200,000 limit.
The American Indian Movement, which was founded in 1968, has been involved in a number of protests and confrontations with the government.
In 1973, AIM members occupied the town of Wounded Knee, S.D., for 71 days.
The occupation ended when the government sent in federal marshals and the National Guard.
Two Indians were killed and 11 were wounded.
The government said the settlement was not an admission of liability."
