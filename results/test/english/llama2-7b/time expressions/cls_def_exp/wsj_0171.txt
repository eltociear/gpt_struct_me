"The U.S. government has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the American Indian Movement over the 1973 shootout at Wounded Knee, S.D., in which two Indians were killed.
The settlement, which was announced Monday, is the largest in U.S. history.
The government had been fighting the suit since 1974, when AIM filed it in federal court in Minneapolis.
The suit alleged that the government had failed to protect the Indians from the Minneapolis-based FBI and the South Dakota National Guard.
The government had argued that the Indians were not entitled to damages because they had not been injured by the government.
The settlement was reached after a federal judge in Minneapolis ruled in 1987 that the Indians were entitled to damages.
The government had appealed that ruling, but the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
The settlement will be paid over 10 years.
The government will pay $100 million in the first year, $200 million in the second year and $300 million in the third year.
The remaining $400 million will be paid in the fourth through 10th years.
The settlement will be paid from the Justice Department's general fund.
The government will also pay $100 million to the Indians to cover legal fees.
The Indians will use the money to pay for health care, education and other services.
The settlement is the latest in a series of large settlements involving the government.
