Input:
"The United States and Soviet Union conferred in Washington on putting an anti-Iraq naval blockade under a United Nations umbrella. The United States has provided most of the naval vessels so far to block Iraqi trade, with Britain, West Germany and Australia among the other nations lending support at sea. The embargo is meant to cripple Iraq by cutting off its exports of oil and imports of food and military supplies.
Iraq imports about three-quarters of its foodstuffs. U.S. allies and other U.N. members have objected that the Security Council embargo resolution did not specifically authorize such a naval operation. Bush told a news conference on Tuesday that the naval barricade now in force might be extended to Jordan's Aqaba ``if it is a hole through which commerce flows'' in and out of Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, today is the eighth day of ``Desert Shield,'' the operation designed to confront an estimated 200,000 Iraqi soldiers now in Kuwait. Iraq boasts an army of 1 million members. At least 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to be committed to Desert Shield within weeks, including Marines, Army air assault forces, paratroopers and infantry. Iraq said it invaded Kuwait because of disputes over oil and money. It accused Kuwait of deliberately slashing Iraqi oil revenues by overproducing oil and driving down prices, among other charges. Iraq has 17 million residents, and Kuwait about 1.9 million."
