"The U.S. government has decided to impose a 25% tariff on imports of Japanese motorcycles, the White House said Friday.
The decision, which was made by President Reagan, is the result of a World Trade Organization ruling that the United States had violated international trade rules by imposing a 45% tariff on Japanese motorcycles.
The WTO ruled in 1984 that the 45% tariff was illegal under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Barriers, which was signed by the United States, Japan and other countries in 1986.
