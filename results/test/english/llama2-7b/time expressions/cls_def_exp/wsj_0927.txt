"The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the government can't force a person to testify against himself in a criminal case.
The 6-3 decision, written by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, said the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination applies to a defendant's testimony in a criminal case.
The ruling overturned a 1984 decision that said the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination applies only to a defendant's testimony in a civil case.
The ruling came in a case involving a man who was convicted of murdering his wife.
The man, who was sentenced to death, was ordered to testify against himself in a civil case brought by his wife's family.
The man refused to testify, saying it would incriminate him in the murder case.
The Supreme Court ruled that the man's testimony in the civil case could not be used against him in the criminal case.
The ruling was a victory for the man, who was sentenced to death.
The ruling was also a victory for the American Civil Liberties Union, which had argued that the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination applies to a defendant's testimony in a criminal case.
The ruling was a defeat for the government, which had argued that the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination applies only to a defendant's testimony in a civil case.
