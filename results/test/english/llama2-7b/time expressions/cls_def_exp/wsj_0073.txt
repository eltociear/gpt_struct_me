"The U.S. government is considering a plan to allow the sale of 100 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help ease the gulf crisis, a senior administration official said today.
The plan, which would be implemented if the crisis continues, would be a ``significant'' release of oil from the reserve, the official said.
The official said the plan would be presented to the White House Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy, which is chaired by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
