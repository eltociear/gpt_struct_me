"Iraq's Saddam Hussein, his options for ending the Persian Gulf crisis growing increasingly unpleasant, assumed the role of embattled Arab hero in offering his first rough proposal for a negotiated end to the confrontation. The Iraqi leader, in an "initiative" designed as much to rally Arab public opinion as to launch meaningful negotiations, announced yesterday that he will withdraw his troops from Kuwait only if Israel withdraws from the West Bank and Syria from Lebanon. He apparently hopes to lure support from Arabs who have spurned him so far by suggesting that Iraq will use its occupation of Kuwait as a lever to solve the Arab world's most frustrating problem, the 23-year Israeli occupation of land claimed by Palestinians.
Even as Saddam Hussein was searching for a ploy to ease his isolation, though, the international pressure against him clicked up another notch. The White House yesterday disclosed that Kuwait's ousted government has formally asked the U.S. to enforce the total trade embargo the United Nations has imposed on Iraq, allowing the U.S. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods. Secretary of State James Baker, speaking on ABC's "This Week," said the U.S.S.S.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam's.Saddam'saddam's.Saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddam'saddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsaddsadds
