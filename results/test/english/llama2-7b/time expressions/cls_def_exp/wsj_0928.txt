"The U.S. government has decided to allow the sale of a new type of computer chip that is expected to be used in a wide range of products, including personal computers, cellular telephones and automobiles.
The decision, announced by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, is the first time the government has approved the sale of a new type of chip that is based on a technology called ``complementary metal oxide semiconductors.''
The decision is a victory for Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of microprocessors, which has been lobbying the government for more than a year to allow the sale of the new chips.
The new chips, which are made by Intel and other companies, are expected to be used in a wide range of products, including personal computers, cellular telephones and automobiles.
