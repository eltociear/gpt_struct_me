["BONN, Germany (AP)_ A phony address listed on disclosure forms for a French donor will cost the far-right German People's Union about 549,000 marks (dlrs 305,000), parliament said Friday. Parliamentary president Rita Suessmuth said the People's Union correctly listed Jacques de Mathan as having donated about 274,500 marks in 1995, but gave a false address for him. German law requires parties to publish the name and address of anyone who donates more than 20,000 marks (dlrs 11,000). The anti-foreigner party said it wanted to protect the donor from possible attacks. Suessmuth said, however, that the law does not allow for providing a false address for any reason. The fine is twice the donation, as provided for under German party financing laws. Party spokesman Bernd Droese said the People's Union would challenge the fine in court. The extremist party recently took a surprising 13 percent of the vote in elections in a depressed eastern German state, and hopes to win its first seats in the federal parliament this September.

Explanation:

Time expressions are linguistic elements that allow us to communicate information about time. In addition to representing specific points in time, they can also be used to classify time periods according to units such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years.

Time expressions can be extracted from a sentence by identifying the words that indicate a specific time or time period. For example, the word "next week" indicates that the time period being referred to is next week, while the word "Friday" indicates that the time period being referred to is Friday.

Once the time expressions have been identified, they can be extracted from the sentence and stored in a list. The list can then be used to represent the time period being referred to in the sentence.

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP)_ An American leader of a U.N. weapons inspection team resumed work in Iraq Friday, nearly two months after his team was effectively blocked. Scott Ritter led his team on a 10-hour tour of three suspected weapons sites classified as ``sensitive'' by the Iraqi authorities, U.N. spokesman Alan Dacey said. ``All sites were inspected to the satisfaction of the inspection team and with full cooperation of Iraqi authorities,'' Dacey said. At least one of the sensitive sites was a barracks of the elite Republican Guard, a well-placed source told The Associated Press. Previously the Iraqis have resisted attempts to inspect such quarters. The U.N. Security Council has charged the inspectors with verifying that Iraq has destroyed its long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction. It was the first time that Ritter, who arrived Thursday with some 50 inspectors for a tour likely to last over a week, had been allowed to carry out an inspection since Jan. 13. Then the Baghdad government stopped providing Ritter's team with escorts, making it impossible for him to enter any site. Iraq alleged Ritter was an American spy whose team had a disproportionately high number of Americans and Britons. The official Iraqi News Agency, which gives the daily tally of inspections, did not mention Ritter by name, but said Friday that team no. 225 _ which Ritter heads _ made surprise visits to a number of sites and was assisted by aerial surveillance. Five other U.N. inspection teams visited a total of nine other sites, the agency reported. An Iraqi official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said Ritter would not try to visit any of the eight presidential sites that Baghdad had placed off-limits to U.N. weapons inspectors. The official said these sites could only be visited by a special team of U.N. monitors and diplomats as laid down by the Feb. 23 accord signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Ritter's return is seen as something of a test of that agreement, under which Iraq agreed to give inspectors full access to eight of Saddam Hussein's presidential palaces. The United States had moved additional troops and a naval armada into the Gulf and said it would strike Ira
