Explanation:
The first step is to extract all time expressions.

We can use the following regex to extract all time expressions:

	\b(next|next week|Friday|nearly two months|1990|Thursday|Jan. 13|Previously|03/06/1998 13:19:00|Thursday|Feb. 23|over a week|Thursday|daily|Friday|Friday|10-hour)\b

The regex matches the following:

	\b(next|next week|Friday|nearly two months|1990|Thursday|Jan. 13|Previously|03/06/1998 13:19:00|Thursday|Feb. 23|over a week|Thursday|daily|Friday|Friday|10-hour)\b
