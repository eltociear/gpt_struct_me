"The U.S. government has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the state of Florida over the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the Justice Department said Thursday.
The settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge, is the largest ever paid by the government in a terrorism case.
The government agreed to pay $1.1 billion to Florida and $100 million to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owned the World Trade Center.
The settlement ends a lawsuit filed by Florida in 1998, which alleged that the government had failed to protect the World Trade Center from terrorist attacks.
The lawsuit was filed after a truck bomb exploded in the parking garage beneath the North Tower of the World Trade Center on Feb. 26, 1993, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000.
The government has paid more than $1 billion in damages to victims of the bombing.
