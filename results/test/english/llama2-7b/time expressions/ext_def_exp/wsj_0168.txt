"The U.S. government has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the families of 600 people killed in the 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. The settlement, which was announced Friday, is the largest ever paid by the U.S. government in a terrorism case. The settlement was reached after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that the government could not be held liable for the bombing. The families had sued the government, claiming that the U.S. military had failed to provide adequate security for the barracks. The bombing, which killed 241 U.S. servicemen, was carried out by a group of Islamic militants known as Hezbollah. The group has been designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. The settlement will be paid out over a period of 10 years, with the first payment of $250 million due in 2003. The families of the victims will receive an average of $2.5 million each. The settlement is the latest in a series of large payouts by the U.S. government to victims of terrorism. In 2002, the government paid $2.2 billion to the families of victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The government has also paid out billions of dollars in compensation to victims of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York City.
