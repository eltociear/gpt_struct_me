"The U.S. government has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the families of 600 people killed in the 1983 bombing of a U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. The settlement, announced Friday, is the largest ever paid by the U.S. government in a terrorism case. The families had sued the government under a law that allows relatives of people killed in terrorist attacks to sue the government for damages. The lawsuit was filed in 1992. The families had accused the government of failing to provide adequate security for the Marines. The bombing killed 241 Marines, 18 sailors and three soldiers. The attack was blamed on Islamic militants. The settlement was reached after the families agreed to drop a lawsuit against the government's insurance company, the Federal Employees Compensation Act. The government had argued that the insurance company was not liable for the attack because it was not a terrorist act.
