The task is to extract all time expressions.

Time expressions are linguistic elements that allow us to communicate information about time. In addition to representing specific points in time, they can also be used to classify time periods according to units such as seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years.

The following are examples of time expressions:

* "next week"
* "Friday"
* "nearly two months"
* "1990"
* "Thursday"
* "Jan. 13"
* "Previously"
* "03/06/1998 13:19:00"
* "Thursday"
* "Feb. 23"
* "over a week"
* "Thursday"
* "daily"
* "Friday"
* "Friday"
* "10-hour"
