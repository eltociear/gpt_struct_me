"The U.S. government has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the state of New York over the collapse of the WorldCom Inc. telecommunications company, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The settlement, which was reached on Thursday, is the largest ever in a securities class-action lawsuit, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the settlement has not been made public.
The settlement, which is subject to court approval, is expected to be announced as early as Monday, the person said.
The settlement is the latest in a series of legal actions against WorldCom, which filed for bankruptcy protection in July 2002 after disclosing a $3.8 billion accounting scandal.
The company, which is now known as MCI Inc., has agreed to pay $600 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC also has sued former WorldCom Chief Executive Bernard Ebbers and former Chief Financial Officer Scott Sullivan.
The SEC has accused Ebbers and Sullivan of fraud and conspiracy.
Ebbers and Sullivan have denied the charges.
