"The U.S. government has decided to allow the sale of a new type of genetically engineered corn that is resistant to a common weed killer, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
The decision by the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service means that the corn, which is engineered to resist the herbicide Roundup, can be sold commercially.
The decision was made after the department's scientists concluded that the corn poses no threat to the environment or to human health.
The corn, which is made by Monsanto Co., is the first genetically engineered crop to be approved for commercial sale in the United States.
The company has said it plans to sell the corn to farmers in the Midwest and Southwest.
The decision was made after the department's scientists concluded that the corn poses no threat to the environment or to human health."
