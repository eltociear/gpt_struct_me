Input:
"The U.S. government has decided to allow the sale of a new type of genetically engineered corn to farmers, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
The decision, which was expected, will allow the sale of the corn, which is engineered to resist the herbicide Roundup, to farmers in 1999.
The decision was made after the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration determined that the corn, made by Monsanto Co., poses no environmental or health risks.
The corn, called Roundup Ready corn, is engineered to resist the herbicide Roundup, which is made by Monsanto.
The corn is the first genetically engineered crop to be approved for sale in the United States.
