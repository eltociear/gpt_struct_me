"The U.S. government has decided to allow the sale of a new type of genetically engineered corn to farmers, the Agriculture Department said Thursday. The decision by the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service means that the corn, which has been genetically altered to resist insects, can be planted in the United States. The corn, called Bt corn, is made by Monsanto Co. of St. Louis. The company said it has been selling the corn in Canada since 1995. The corn is engineered to produce a toxin that kills certain insects that feed on it. The toxin is produced by a bacterium that is naturally found in soil. The toxin is not harmful to humans or animals that eat the corn. The decision by the Agriculture Department means that the corn can be planted in the United States without special approval from the department. The department said it will continue to monitor the corn to make sure it does not harm the environment. The decision was made after a review by the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
