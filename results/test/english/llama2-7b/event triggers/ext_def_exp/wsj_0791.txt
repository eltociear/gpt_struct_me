"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal by a former executive of the now-defunct Enron Corp. who was convicted of insider trading.
The justices let stand a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans that upheld the conviction of former Enron executive Michael Kopper.
Kopper was convicted in 2002 of insider trading for selling $1.2 million in Enron stock in 2001, just before the energy company filed for bankruptcy protection.
Kopper was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine.
The 5th Circuit upheld the conviction in 2003, saying Kopper had a duty to disclose his knowledge of Enron's financial problems.
Kopper's attorneys had argued that the 5th Circuit's ruling was inconsistent with a 2002 Supreme Court decision that said a person who has inside information about a company's financial condition has no duty to disclose that information.
The Supreme Court's action Monday means the 5th Circuit's ruling stands."
