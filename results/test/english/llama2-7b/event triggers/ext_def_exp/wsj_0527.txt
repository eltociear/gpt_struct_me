"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal by the state of Texas in a case involving the state's refusal to issue a marriage license to a lesbian couple.
The court's action means that the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in favor of the lesbian couple, Deborah and Sandra Lawrence, will stand.
The appeals court ruled in June that Texas' refusal to issue a marriage license to the couple violated the U.S. Constitution's equal protection clause.
The couple had been denied a marriage license in 1998 by a Texas county clerk.
The couple's attorney, Chuck Smith, said the Supreme Court's action means that the 5th Circuit's ruling will stand.
The couple's case was one of several that were consolidated in the 5th Circuit.
The 5th Circuit's ruling was the first by a federal appeals court to strike down a state's refusal to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple.
The 5th Circuit's ruling was also the first by a federal appeals court to strike down a state's refusal to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple.
