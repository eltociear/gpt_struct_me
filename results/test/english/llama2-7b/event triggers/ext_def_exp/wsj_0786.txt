"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal by a group of investors who claimed that the government's 1995 decision to allow the sale of the U.S. Savings and Loan Corp. to the Resolution Trust Corp. was unconstitutional.
The investors, who had bought the S&L's assets, had argued that the sale was unconstitutional because it violated the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against the government taking private property for public use without just compensation.
The investors had sought to block the sale, which was approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the lower court's decision.
The Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case means that the lower court's ruling stands.
The case is In re: U.S. Savings and Loan Corp., 99-1011."
