"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal by a former executive of the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who was convicted of insider trading.
The court's action leaves in place a ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that upheld the conviction of Michael Milken, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Milken, who was once the highest-paid executive in the United States, was convicted in 1990 of 96 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy.
The charges stemmed from Milken's role in a $2 billion junk bond deal involving the sale of bonds to the Penn Central Corp. in 1986.
Milken was convicted of insider trading because he had advance knowledge of the sale of Penn Central to the Pennsylvania RR Co.
The 2nd Circuit upheld Milken's conviction in 1992.
Milken's lawyers had argued that the 2nd Circuit's ruling was inconsistent with a 1988 Supreme Court decision that said a person cannot be convicted of insider trading unless he or she has a duty to disclose the information.
The Supreme Court's action Monday was without comment.
Milken, 43, is serving his sentence at a federal prison in Otisville, N.Y.
He is expected to be released in 1996."
