["Rogers Communications Inc. plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares", "Perpetual preferred shares aren't retractable by the holders", "Rogers said the shares will be convertible into Class B shares", "the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place", "the coupon rate hasn't yet been fixed, but will probably be set at around 8%"]

Explanation:

1. "Rogers Communications Inc. plans to raise 175 million to 180 million Canadian dollars through a private placement of perpetual preferred shares" - This is an event trigger as it describes a future action that the company will take.
2. "Perpetual preferred shares aren't retractable by the holders" - This is an event trigger as it describes a characteristic of the preferred shares being offered.
3. "Rogers said the shares will be convertible into Class B shares" - This is an event trigger as it describes a potential future action that the shares may be converted into.
4. "the company has the option to redeem the shares before a conversion takes place" - This is an event trigger as it describes a potential future action that the company may take.
5. "the coupon rate hasn't yet been fixed, but will probably be set at around 8%" - This is not an event trigger as it is a statement about the future, but it is not describing a specific future action or state.

Note: In this example, the event triggers are all in the form of sentences that describe future actions or states. These sentences are all in the present tense, which is appropriate because they are describing future events that have not yet occurred.
