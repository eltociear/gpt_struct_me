Explanation:
The task is to extract all event triggers from the given text. An event trigger is a word, phrase or sentence that indicates an event has occurred or is about to occur. In this text, the following words and phrases indicate events:

* "offered to buy" (indicates the event of a purchase offer)
* "stock swap" (indicates the event of a stock exchange)
* "preferred stock" (indicates the event of a new stock issue)
* "dividend rate" (indicates the event of a dividend payment)
* "convertible into Heritage common" (indicates the event of a conversion of preferred stock into common stock)

Note that some event triggers may be implied rather than explicitly stated. For example, the phrase "plunged $4 to $14.75" implies the event of a stock price change.
