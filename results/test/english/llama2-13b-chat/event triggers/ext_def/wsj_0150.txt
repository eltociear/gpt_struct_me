["merged into Primerica Corp.", "cleared the transaction", "paid 0.82 share for each Williams share", "delisted from the New York Stock Exchange", "closed at $23.25", "down 12.5 cents", "acquired certain assets", "assumed certain liabilities"]

Explanation:

* "merged into Primerica Corp." is an event trigger because it indicates that a specific action (the merger) has taken place.
* "cleared the transaction" is an event trigger because it indicates that a specific action (the transaction) has been approved or completed.
* "paid 0.82 share for each Williams share" is an event trigger because it indicates that a specific action (the payment) has taken place.
* "delisted from the New York Stock Exchange" is an event trigger because it indicates that a specific action (the delisting) has taken place.
* "closed at $23.25" is not an event trigger because it simply states a fact about the current state of the Williams shares, rather than indicating a specific action or change.
* "down 12.5 cents" is not an event trigger for the same reason.
* "acquired certain assets" and "assumed certain liabilities" are not event triggers because they are simply statements about the transaction and do not indicate any specific actions or changes.
