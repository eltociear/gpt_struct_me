Event triggers:
1. Iraq's Saddam Hussein assumes the role of embattled Arab hero in offering his first rough proposal for a negotiated end to the confrontation.
2. The Iraqi leader, in an "initiative" designed as much to rally Arab public opinion as to launch meaningful negotiations, announces that he will withdraw his troops from Kuwait only if Israel withdraws from the West Bank and Syria from Lebanon.
3. The White House discloses that Kuwait's ousted government has formally asked the U.S. to enforce the total trade embargo the United Nations has imposed on Iraq, allowing the U.S. and other nations to immediately begin stopping ships carrying Iraqi goods.
4. Secretary of State James Baker says the Kuwaiti request gives the U.S. and other countries "a legal basis for stopping the export of oil and that sort of thing."
5. The U.S. maintains that under the U.N. charter, the Kuwaiti request triggers steps for the collective enforcement of international sanctions.
6. Mr. Baker declines to use the word blockade, but said that "interdiction" of Iraqi shipments would begin " almost instantly."
7. In a statement, the White House says it would do "whatever is necessary" to ensure compliance with the sanctions.
8. Other Bush administration officials say that the international naval force in the area -- consisting of American, British, French, Canadian, Soviet, German and Australian ships -- may be used both to stop oil exports from leaving Iraq and Kuwait and to stop shipments of food and other goods from going in.
9. President Bush implied as much yesterday when reporters asked whether the interdiction would apply to food. The president responded, "Everything, everything."
10. While shying away from actually using the word "blockade," Mr. Bush acknowledged that the U.S. and others were trying to block shipping to Iraq.
11. Iraq's first option, of course, may be simply to sit tight and hope it can endure a trade embargo longer than the West can live without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
12. Speaking on the ABC program, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Iraq's ambassador to the U.N., asserted that an embargo on Iraq could plunge the U.S. into a "depression" and the rest of the world into an economic "crisis."
13. Iraq clearly is trying to woo back more Arab support in case the conflict drags on, hoping that its neighbors eventually will help it survive a prolonged war of economic attrition with the West.
14. Saddam Hussein on Friday tried to scare other Arab leaders into supporting him by calling on Arabs to rise up in a holy war against leaders who invited American and other Western soldiers into Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom.
15. Then yesterday, he tried to entice Arab leaders with his proposal for a diplomatic solution linking his occupation of Kuwait with Israel's occupation of the West Bank.
16. The proposal also called for replacing American and other Western troops in Saudi Arabia with Arab forces.
17. The Bush administration immediately said it "categorically" rejects the proposals.
18. And President Bush yesterday, asked whether he was at least glad Iraq is discussing negotiations, replied: "I don't see anything to be pleasing in there at all."
19. American strategists are calculating, though, that the trade sanctions -- enforced by an effective though perhaps undeclared naval blockade -- will hold tightly enough to convince Iraq that it will lose in the long run by simply standing pat.
20. At that point, rather than go through the humiliation of backing out of Kuwait, the Iraqis might well conclude that they need to lash out in some way to shake things up.
21. In that event, Saddam Hussein appears to have three choices.
22. The first would be to launch the much-feared direct invasion of Saudi Arabia, hoping to seize some Saudi oil fields and improve his bargaining position.
23. But that option is growing less and less likely as thousands of American, British, Egyptian, Syrian and Moroccan forces assemble in and around Saudi Arabia to protect the kingdom.
24. The Saudis even have in
