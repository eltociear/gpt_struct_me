Event triggers:
1. Polly Peck International Inc. agrees to acquire 51% of Sansui Electric Co.
2. The acquisition is seen as a sign that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies, provided the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction.
3. Sansui expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen.
4. Foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year, while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies.
5. The Sansui deal is not expected to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases due to the strong yen and high stock prices of Japanese companies, as well as cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes.
6. Sansui was once one of Japan's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles, but has failed to branch into other new businesses as the market has moved toward less expensive "mini-component" sets.
7. The yen soared in recent years, deepening Sansui's financial problems and creating a vicious circle in which the company was unable to move production offshore.
8. Even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern, some management consultants maintain.
9. Polly Peck's acquisition of Sansui is seen as a way to expand Sansui's product line and move its production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into Polly Peck's own factories.
10. The acquisition is seen as a risk-taking move by Polly Peck, which is not jettisoning the existing top-management structure of Sansui but is bringing in a former Toshiba Corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer.
