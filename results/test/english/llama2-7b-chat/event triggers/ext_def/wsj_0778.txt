Event triggers:
1. "The government is sharpening its newest weapon against white-collar defendants: the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills."
2. "The issue has come to a boil in Newark, N.J., where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for Eddie Antar that if the founder and former chairman of Crazy Eddie Inc. is indicted, the government may move to seize the money that Mr. Antar is using to pay legal fees."
3. "The warning by the U.S. attorney's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June. In those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment."
4. "If the government succeeds in seizing Mr. Antar's assets, he could be left without top-flight legal representation, because his attorneys are likely to quit, according to individuals familiar with the case."
5. "A seizure also would make the case the largest -- and one of the first -- in which lawyers' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs."
6. "The people who suffer in the short run are defendants, but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people, because there won't be a vigorous private bar to defend the Bill of Rights," says Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures."
7. "Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark, where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges."
8. "Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant's assets before trial."
9. "Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar's attorneys that they believe Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities."
10. "Justin Feldman and Jack Arseneault, attorneys for Mr. Antar, both declined to comment on the matter."
11. "In Newark, U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito said, 'I don't think there's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases.'"
12. "Mr. Alito said his office 'just responded to an attorney's question about whether we would go after attorney's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that right.'"
