Event triggers:
1. Investors are pouring out of junk-bond mutual funds, undermining a pillar of support in the already reeling junk market.
2. Last week alone, an eye-popping $1.6 billion flowed out of the junk funds, or nearly 5% of their total assets, according to estimates by Dalbar Financial Services Inc.
3. In the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says.
4. Some fund managers say negative publicity has exacerbated investors' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices.
5. Mutual fund groups haven't lost control of much of the outgoing money, says Louis Harvey, Dalbar's president.
6. Mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts, and to a lesser extent, government-bond funds.
7. The $1.5 billion Fidelity High Income Fund has had a net outflow of about $150 million in the past two months.
8. About $60 million streamed out last week alone, double the level of the week following last month's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze.
9. About 98% of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds, says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing.
10. Vanguard's $1 billion High Yield Bond Portfolio has seen $161 million flow out since early September; $14 million of that seeped out Friday Oct. 13 alone.
11. At the $932 million T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund, investors yanked out about $182 million in the past two months.
12. Junk-fund holders have barely broken even this year, as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices.
13. Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues, such as RJR Nabisco, to raise cash to meet expected redemptions.
14. Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers.
15. Says Michael Hirsch, chief investment officer of Republic National Bank and manager of the FundTrust Group in New York: "It's a time bomb just waiting to go off."
