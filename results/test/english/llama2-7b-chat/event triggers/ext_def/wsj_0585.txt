["Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading."] 
["Their motivation, however, has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks."] 
["Stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard amp Poor's 500-stock index."] 
["The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it amounted to more than 13% in September."] 
["Other market-maker gripes: Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market."] 
["Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity."] 
["The price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses them."] 
["Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market."] 
["But the big, often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who were profiting from the practice against it."] 
["Peter DaPuzzo, head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton, acknowledges that he wasn't troubled by program trading when it began in the pre-crash bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising."] 
["'We weren't as concerned until they became sell programs,' says Mr. DaPuzzo, who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility."] 
["Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Kidder Peabody, in addition to Shearson, do program-trade OTC stocks."] 
["Shearson, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs say they do so only for customers, however."] 
["Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients' accounts."] 
["Of course, there were sell programs in past years, too, but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days."] 
["That's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash, when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled."] 
["Market makers, to cut costs, slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren't selling."] 
["And to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further, market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress."] 
["On days when prices are tumbling, they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will."] 
["'It makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you're going to lose,' says Mr. Antolini, of Donaldson Lufkin."] 
["But this skittishness, Mr. Antolini says, is creating liquidity problems in certain OTC stocks."] 
["'It's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers don't want to { take the orders}. No one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks.'"] 
["Joseph Hardiman, president of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees trading on Nasdaq, agrees that program trading is hurting the market's efforts to bring back small investors."] 
["But, he observes, while makers suffer losses when program trading drags the market down, they also make money when program trading pushes the prices higher."] 
["'Sometimes {traders} lose sight of that,' he says."]
