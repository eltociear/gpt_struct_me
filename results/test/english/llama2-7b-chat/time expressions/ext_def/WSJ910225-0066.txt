• So far, the offensive is progressing with dramatic success.
• While cautioning about the uncertainty of early battle reports, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said late yesterday that "the operation has been very successful."
• Amid reports that thousands of Iraqi soldiers had surrendered, administration aides were also upbeat in private, with one even talking of victory within a week.
• But even continued military success carries political and diplomatic risks for President Bush and the U.S.
• The allied rejection of the last-minute Soviet-led diplomatic effort to avoid the ground war enabled Mr. Bush to seize the initiative from an Iraq seemingly bent on dictating peace terms.
• Now, he says, "it looks like the West just wants to destroy Iraq."
• Despite the early indications of success, the allied forces could still suffer greater casualties and become bogged down militarily, especially when they encounter the tough Republican Guard, which is entrenched along the Iraq-Kuwait border.
• If so, and if it appears that the American goal actually is to destroy the Iraqi regime even at the cost of badly hurting Iraqi society, "the lingering cost of that could be high," worries former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski.
• But, he notes, "If everything crumbles totally, that won't be such a problem."
• American officials staunchly disavow any interest in driving through Iraq toward Baghdad, either in pursuit of Saddam Hussein himself or to set up some American-controlled government inside Iraq.
• The Americans say their battle plans call for operating against forces inside Iraq as far north as the city of Basra, about 30 miles north of Kuwait, but say there isn't any plan to drive beyond that.
• Nevertheless, French President Francois Mitterrand said yesterday that some allied forces are crossing Iraqi territory as part of a "pincer" movement to trap the soldiers occupying Kuwait, but insisted, "The purpose isn't to invade Iraqi territory, that's not the aim, that isn't the mandate."
• Of course, it is still far too early to assume that the military situation on the ground will stay as smooth for allied forces as it appears to have been so far.
• Iraq still has the potential to cause significant problems by using forces and weapons that don't yet seem fully engaged.
• For one thing, Iraq still apparently hasn't unleashed its stockpile of chemical weapons.
• Gen. Schwarzkopf said that some early reports that chemical weapons were used against allied troops turned out to be "bogus."
• Iraq is believed to have the ability to deliver chemical weapons in artillery shells or, perhaps, atop Soviet-made Frog7 missiles.
• Perhaps more important, it appears that allied troops haven't yet fully engaged Iraq's vaunted Republican Guard, which has been sitting just north of the Iraq-Kuwait border and is considered the most potent element in the Iraqi defense.
• It remains to be seen how much damage the allied air campaign was able to inflict on the Guard, and whether President Hussein will commit his most valued troops to a fight-to-the-death finish.
• Certainly Saddam Hussein continues to implore his country to fight on.
• "Fight them," he urged Iraqis in a radio address. "All Iraqis, fight them with all the power you have, and all struggle for everything."
• U.S. war planners have long assumed that the early stage of the ground attack, in which American forces would use their speed to sweep around Iraqi defenses and their strength to punch through the relatively weak Iraqi front line, would be the easiest part.
• Despite these early successes, the mere fact that a ground campaign has begun almost guarantees that the Bush administration will face fresh problems growing out of the military situation.
• There are likely to be additional American prisoners of war taken, and there are signs that President Hussein is taking Kuwaiti hostages.
• U.S. and Kuwaiti officials say there are reports that large numbers of civilians from Kuwait City are being rounded up and held by Iraqi troops, apparently either for use as human shields or for use later in bargaining once the war is over.
• President Bush's political argument for going to a ground
