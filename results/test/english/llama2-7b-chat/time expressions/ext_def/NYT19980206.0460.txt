"It was the third consecutive month that job generation has been exceptionally strong",
"with growing opportunities for work drawing more people into the labor force",
"the unemployment rate remained at 4.7 percent last month",
"just a notch above its quarter-century low",
"the demand for workers also led employers to raise wages again last month",
"Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees rose 4 cents, to $12.51",
"the gain left wages 3.8 percent higher than a year earlier",
"extending a trend that has given back to workers some of the earning power they lost to inflation in the last decade",

"The job figures for January extended a surge in employment gains that began last fall",
"just when the labor market had showed signs of cooling",
"After accounting for a small downward revision Friday to December's figures",
"the economy has been creating jobs at a rate of 358,000 a month for the last four months",
"and 381,000 over the last three months",
"after averaging 242,000 for the first nine months of 1997",
"The surge in jobs reflects a remarkable confluence of positive and self-reinforcing economic forces",
"Inflation has been almost nonexistent",
"and consumer confidence has been extremely strong",
"After a short, sharp drop when Asia's financial problems first became clear",
"the stock market has rebounded and corporate profits have remained healthy",
"Long-term interest rates, an important indicator of economic stability",
"have fallen in the last few months",
