Note:
The output is a list of time expressions in the input text. Each time expression is represented as a JSON object with the following properties:
* "time": the time expression (e.g. "completed", "purchasing", etc.)
* "timeUnit": the unit of time associated with the expression (e.g. "seconds", "minutes", "hours", etc.)
* "value": the value of the time expression (e.g. the number of seconds, minutes, hours, etc.)

Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions, including:

* "completed" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "purchasing" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "including" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "of" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "the" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "for" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "also" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "including" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "of" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "the" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "in" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "months" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "follows" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "brought" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "announced" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "received" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "put" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "received" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "lowered" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "meanwhile" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "indicating" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "two" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)
* "never" (timeUnit: "seconds", value: 3000)

Note that the time unit for each time expression is inferred based on the context in which the expression appears in the input text. For example, the time unit for "completed" is "seconds" because it is used in a financial context where time is typically measured in seconds. Similarly, the time unit for "put" is also "seconds" because it is used in a financial context where time is typically measured in seconds.
