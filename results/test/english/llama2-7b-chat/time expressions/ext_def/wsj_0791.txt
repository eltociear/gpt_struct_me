Note:
The output is a list of time expressions in the input text. The time expressions are identified using the format "X Y", where X is a unit of time (such as second, minute, hour, day, week, month, or year) and Y is a specific value or range of values associated with that unit. For example, "recently" is a time expression that represents a specific time period (i.e., within the past few days or weeks). Similarly, "within the next few days" is a time expression that represents a specific time period (i.e., within the next 2-3 days).
