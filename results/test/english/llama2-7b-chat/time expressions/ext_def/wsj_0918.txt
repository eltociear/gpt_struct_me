"Du Pont Co. reported that third-quarter profit grew a robust 19% from a year ago on the strength of the company's operations in various chemicals and fibers, and in petroleum.
* Third-quarter profit grew 19% to $547 million from $461 million a year ago.
* The company raised its quarterly dividend to $1.20 a share from $1.05, an increase that will increase the annualized payout to shareholders by some $140 million.
* The dividend increase was Du Pont's second this year, an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders.
* Leading the gains for Du Pont in the latest quarter was its industrial products segment, where profit soared to $155 million from $99 million a year earlier.
* Profit climbed to $98 million from $71 million in the petroleum segment, as Du Pont's Conoco Inc. oil company was helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume.
* In the diversified businesses segment, which includes herbicides, profit grew to $64 million from $27 million.
* Two segments posted lower earnings for the quarter. Profit from coal fell to $41 million from $58 million, partly because of a miners' strike. And profit from polymers dropped to $107 million from $122 million amid what Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets.
* For the nine months, Du Pont earned $2 billion, or $8.46 a share, up 18% from $1.69 billion, or $7.03 a share, a year earlier.
* Sales increased 10% to $26.54 billion from $24.05 billion.
* The increased dividend will be paid Dec. 14 to holders of record Nov. 15.
* The stock split, which is subject to holder approval, would be paid on a still unspecified date in January to holders of record Dec. 21."
