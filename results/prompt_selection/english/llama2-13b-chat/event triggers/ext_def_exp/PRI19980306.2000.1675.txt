["heavy gunfire", "offensive", "people fleeing", "official Serb sources", "operation", "future", "much wider conflict"]

Explanation:
The task is to extract all event triggers from the given text. An event trigger is a word, phrase or expression that indicates the occurrence of an event. In this text, the following words and phrases are event triggers:

* "heavy gunfire" (indicates the event of shooting)
* "offensive" (indicates the event of an attack)
* "people fleeing" (indicates the event of people leaving their homes)
* "official Serb sources" (indicates the event of a statement or announcement being made)
* "operation" (indicates the event of an action or activity being carried out)
* "future" (indicates the event of something that will happen in the future)
* "much wider conflict" (indicates the event of a larger and more extensive conflict)

Note that some event triggers may be implied rather than explicitly stated, and some events may be inferred from the context rather than being explicitly mentioned.
