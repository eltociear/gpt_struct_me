Note:
The list of event triggers should include all instances of events that are described in the text, regardless of whether they are explicitly stated as events or not. For example, "TWA eight hundred climb maintain one five thousand" is an event trigger because it describes an action taking place (the plane climbing to a specific altitude). Similarly, "Ah, we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here about sixteen thousand feet or something like that. It just went down." is an event trigger because it describes a sudden and significant change (the explosion of the plane).
