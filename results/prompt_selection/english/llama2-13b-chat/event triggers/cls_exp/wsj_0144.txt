The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings: the first string is the entity (e.g. "Travelers Corp."), and the second string is the class (e.g. "ORGANIZATION"). The classes are:

* OCCURRENCE: events or occurrences that happen in the world
* I_STATE: states or conditions of entities
* I_ACTION: actions taken by entities
* ASPECTUAL: aspects or features of entities or events
* REPORTING: reporting or mentioning of events or entities
* PERCEPTION: perceptions or interpretations of events or entities
* STATE: states or conditions of entities
* OCCURRENCE: events or occurrences that happen in the world

Note that some entities may be assigned to multiple classes, depending on the context and the specific event or action being described.
