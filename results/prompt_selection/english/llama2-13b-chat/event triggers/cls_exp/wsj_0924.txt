Note:
The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two strings: the first string is the entity (e.g. "Dominion Textile Inc.") and the second string is the class (e.g. "OCCURRENCE"). The classes are:

* OCCURRENCE: events that occur at a specific point in time
* I_ACTION: actions performed by entities
* I_STATE: states of entities
* ASPECTUAL: aspects of entities or events
* REPORTING: reporting of events or states
* PERCEPTION: perceptions of entities or events

Your task is to classify each entity and event in the input text into the appropriate class.
