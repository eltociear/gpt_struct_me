"The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc.",
"Moreover, the amended pact shows how McCaw's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner, forcing huge debt on the proposed new company",
"The debt, estimated at $4.7 billion, could mortgage the cellular company's future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term",
"The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth's and to spin off its broadcasting operations",
"Under new terms of the agreement, announced Friday, LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share",
"In addition, New York-based LIN would exercise its right to buy out for $1.9 billion the 55% equity interest of its partner, Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise",
"McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4% of LIN's stock",
"Under its revised proposal, Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50% interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt",
"To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company",
"McCaw's bid also has a similar clause",
"To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if, after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company isn't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer",
"BellSouth's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts, especially because of the company's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings",
"For 1988, BellSouth earned $1.7 billion, or $3.51 a share, on revenue of $13.6 billion",
"In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth shares fell 87.5 cents to $52.125",
"In national over-the-counter trading, LIN shares soared $4.625 to closed at $112.625, while McCaw fell $2.50 a share to $37.75",
"The proposed BellSouth-LIN cellular company, including the newly acquired Metromedia stake, would give the new entity 55 million potential customers, including about 35 million in the nation's top 10 markets",
"Mr. Leon of Bear Stearns speculated that McCaw, in an attempt to buy time, might consider filing an antitrust suit against BellSouth with the Justice Department and U.S. District Judge Harold Greene",
"Indeed, McCaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement"
