Note:
The date class is only for the first mention of a date in a sentence. If a date is mentioned again in the same sentence, it should not be tagged.

Also, the duration class should only be used for quantities of time that are not specific dates or times. For example, "over a week" should be tagged as a duration, but "Friday" should not.
