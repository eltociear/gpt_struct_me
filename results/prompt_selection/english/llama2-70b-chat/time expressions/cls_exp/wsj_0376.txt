The output is a list of time expressions extracted from the given text. Each element in the list consists of two strings: the first string represents the entity (time expression), and the second string represents the class (Date, Time, Duration, or Set).

For example, "next year's first quarter" is a time expression that belongs to the class Date. Similarly, "#300 million" and "#400 million" are amounts that belong to the class Amount, and "5% to 10%" is a percentage that belongs to the class Percentage. "March 31" is a date that belongs to the class Date, and "last year" and "this year" are dates that belong to the class Date.
