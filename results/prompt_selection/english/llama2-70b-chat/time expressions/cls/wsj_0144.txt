Note:
The output format is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.

In this task, you are given a text and asked to extract and classify all time expressions. The output should be in the format of a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.

The classes in this task are:

* Date: This class includes all expressions that represent a specific date or a range of dates.
* Time: This class includes all expressions that represent a specific time or a duration of time.
* Duration: This class includes all expressions that represent a duration of time, such as "3 months" or "2 years".
* Set: This class includes all expressions that represent a specific set of time, such as "the first quarter" or "the third month".

Your task is to extract and classify all time expressions in the given text. The output should be in the format of a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.

For example, in the text "Travelers Corp.'s third-quarter net income rose 11%", the time expression is "third-quarter" and it belongs to the class "Duration". Therefore, the output for this expression would be [["third-quarter", "Duration"]].

Similarly, the time expression "last month" belongs to the class "Duration" and the output for this expression would be [["last month", "Duration"]].

The time expression "$40 million" belongs to the class "Amount" and the output for this expression would be [["$40 million", "Amount"]].

Note that some expressions may belong to multiple classes. For example, "Travelers Corp.'s earnings from commercial property/casualty lines fell 59% in the latest quarter" contains two time expressions: "latest quarter" and "59%". The first expression belongs to the class "Duration" and the second expression belongs to the class "Amount". Therefore, the output for this expression would be [["latest quarter", "Duration"], ["59%", "Amount"]].

Your output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.
