Note:
The output format is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.

In this task, you are given a text passage and asked to extract and classify all time expressions. The output should be in the format of a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

The classes in this task are:

* Date: This class includes all expressions that represent a specific point in time, such as "third-quarter" or "last month".
* Time: This class includes all expressions that represent a specific time of day, such as "89 cents a share" or "11%".
* Duration: This class includes all expressions that represent a length of time, such as "$40 million" or "59%".
* Amount: This class includes all expressions that represent a quantity of money, such as "$94.2 million" or "$31 million".
* Set: This class includes all expressions that represent a specific set of time, such as "the first nine months" or "the 1988 period".

Your task is to extract and classify all time expressions in the given text passage. The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

Note that the input text passage is just an example, and you should expect to encounter different types of time expressions in different texts. Your goal is to write a program that can extract and classify time expressions accurately and efficiently, regardless of the specific text passage.
