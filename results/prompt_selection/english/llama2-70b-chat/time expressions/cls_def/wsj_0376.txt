Explanation:
The input text contains several temporal expressions that can be classified into different categories.

* "next year's first quarter" is a date expression that refers to a specific point in time in the future.
* "#300 million" and "#400 million" are duration expressions that represent a specific amount of time (in this case, money) that can be used to classify time periods.
* "#1.44 billion" is also a duration expression that represents a specific amount of time (in this case, money).
* "March 31" is a date expression that refers to a specific point in time in the past.
* "5% to 10%" is a duration expression that represents a specific amount of time (in this case, a percentage) that can be used to classify time periods.
* "last year" is a date expression that refers to a specific point in time in the past.
* "this year" is a date expression that refers to a specific point in time in the present.

The output is a list of two-element lists, where each element is a string representing the temporal expression and its corresponding class (Date, Time, Duration, or Set).
