Explanation:
The output is a list of 15 elements, where each element is a list containing two strings. The first string represents the entity, and the second string represents the class.

The classes are:

* Date: Represents a specific point in time, such as "Nov. 22" or "last April".
* Amount: Represents a quantity of money, such as "$780.6 million" or "C$16.40".
* Duration: Represents a period of time, such as "two years".
* Set: Represents a collection of items, such as "18-screen" or "51%".

The entities in the text that match these classes are extracted and listed in the output, along with their corresponding class labels.
