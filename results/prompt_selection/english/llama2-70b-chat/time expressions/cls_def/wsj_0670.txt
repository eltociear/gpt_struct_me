* Date: Expressions that represent a specific point in time, such as "National Intergroup Inc." (the company's name) or "year-ago third quarter" (a specific quarter in the past).
* Time: Expressions that represent a specific time period, such as "third quarter" (a quarter of a year) or "two years" (a specific duration of time).
* Duration: Expressions that represent a quantity of time, such as "$15 million" (the amount of time it takes to earn $15 million) or "$30 million" (the amount of time it takes to earn $30 million).
* Set: Expressions that represent a set of values, such as "54.5%" (the percentage of ownership) or "fiscal 1989" (a specific year).
