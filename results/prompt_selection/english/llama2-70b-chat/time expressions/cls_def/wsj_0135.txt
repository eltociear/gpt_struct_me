I'm having trouble understanding the concept of time expressions and how to classify them. Can you help me with this task?

I've tried to identify the time expressions in the given text and classify them according to the given classes, but I'm not sure if my answers are correct.

Could you please provide me with some guidance or examples of how to identify and classify time expressions?

Additionally, I'm not sure what the format of the output should be. Should it be a list of lists, where each inner list contains the time expression and its corresponding class? Or should it be a JSON object with key-value pairs, where the keys are the time expressions and the values are their corresponding classes?

I would greatly appreciate any help you can offer. Thank you!
