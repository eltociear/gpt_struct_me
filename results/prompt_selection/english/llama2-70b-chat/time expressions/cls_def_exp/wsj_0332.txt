Explanation:
last Wednesday - Date
301 million - Amount
53.2% - Percentage
internal resources - Duration
related Orkem businesses - Set

Note:
The output format is a JSON-parseable list. The first element in each sublist is the entity, and the second is the class.

In this task, you are given a text containing temporal expressions, and you need to extract and classify them into four classes: Date, Time, Duration, and Set. The output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a sublist containing the entity and its corresponding class.

For example, in the given input text, "last Wednesday" should be classified as a Date, "301 million" as an Amount, "53.2%" as a Percentage, "internal resources" as a Duration, and "related Orkem businesses" as a Set.

Note that the classes are not mutually exclusive, and a single temporal expression can belong to multiple classes. For instance, "last Wednesday" can also be classified as a Time, depending on the context.

Your task is to write a program that can extract and classify temporal expressions in a given text and output them in the specified format.
