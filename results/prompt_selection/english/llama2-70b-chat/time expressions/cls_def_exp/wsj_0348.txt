Explanation:
The output is a list of temporal expressions found in the input text. Each expression is a list with two elements: the first is the entity (the actual text of the temporal expression), and the second is the class (the type of temporal expression, such as "Date", "Time", "Duration", or "Set").

For example, "third quarter" is a date expression and is classified as such. "18 cents a share" is a duration expression because it describes a quantity of time (18 cents) in relation to a share (a unit of time). "13 facilities" is a set expression because it describes a collection of items (facilities) that exist at a particular point in time.

Note that some expressions can be classified in multiple ways. For example, "this summer" could also be classified as a date expression, but in this case, it is classified as a duration expression because it describes a period of time (a summer) that is ongoing. Similarly, "$26.875" could be classified as a time expression, but it is classified as a date expression because it represents a specific point in time (the closing price of a stock on a particular day).
