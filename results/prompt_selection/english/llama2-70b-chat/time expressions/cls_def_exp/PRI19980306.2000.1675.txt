Explanation:
The output is a list of pairs, where each pair contains a string (the entity) and a class (Date, Time, Duration, or Set). The classes are based on the type of temporal information conveyed by the entity.

Date:
Indicates a specific point in time, such as "For The World" (a specific date).

Time:
Indicates a specific time of day, such as "this is Pamela McCall" (a specific time).

Duration:
Indicates a length of time, such as "More heavy gunfire" (a duration of time).

Set:
Indicates a set or category of time, such as "in the Serbian province of Kosovo" (a set of locations).

Note that some entities can be classified under more than one class. For example, "BBC correspondent Karyn Coleman reports from Kosovo" can be classified under both Time (a specific time) and Location (a specific location). However, in this task, each entity should only be classified under one class.
