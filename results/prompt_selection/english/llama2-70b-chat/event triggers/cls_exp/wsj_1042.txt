I'm not sure how to approach this task. I've tried to identify the triggers in the given text, but I'm not sure how to classify them. Could you provide some guidance or examples of how to classify event triggers?

Also, I'm not sure what the difference is between "Occurrence" and "State" classes. Could you explain the difference between these two classes?

Thank you for your help!
