Note:
The classes are not mutually exclusive, and some triggers may belong to multiple classes.

This task is an example of a typical NLP task, where you need to extract and classify event triggers in a given text. The event triggers are the words or phrases that indicate the occurrence of an event, such as "laying off" or "earnings rose slightly". The classes are the categories that the event triggers belong to, such as "OCCURRENCE" or "REPORTING".

The input text is a news article about Xerox Corp. laying off employees in its Crum amp Forster personal insurance operations. The output is a list of event triggers and their corresponding classes.

The classes used in this task are:

* OCCURRENCE: Indicates that the event trigger describes an event or occurrence that is happening or has happened.
* REPORTING: Indicates that the event trigger is reporting on a past event or occurrence.
* ASPECTUAL: Indicates that the event trigger describes an event or occurrence that is ongoing or continuous.
* INTENSIONAL ACTION: Indicates that the event trigger describes an action or event that is intended or planned.
* INTENSIONAL STATE: Indicates that the event trigger describes a state or condition that is intended or planned.
* PERCEPTION: Indicates that the event trigger describes a perception or opinion about an event or occurrence.
