Note:
The classes are not mutually exclusive, and some events may belong to multiple classes.

This task is similar to the Stanford Natural Language Processing Group's (SNLPG) task, "Event Argument Extraction" (EAE), but with a different focus. The goal of EAE is to extract the entities and relationships that are involved in a given event mentioned in text, while the goal of this task is to classify the events themselves.
