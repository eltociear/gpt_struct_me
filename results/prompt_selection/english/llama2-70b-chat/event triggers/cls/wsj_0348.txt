Note:
The output format is a list of pairs, where each pair consists of an entity (a string) and a class (a string). The classes are:

* State: Indicates a state of being or a condition.
* Occurrence: Indicates an event or a happening.
* Reporting: Indicates a report or a statement about something.
* Perception: Indicates a perception or an observation.
* Aspectual: Indicates an aspect or a feature.
* Intensional Action: Indicates an action or a activity with a specific intention.
* Intensional State: Indicates a state of being with a specific intention.

In this task, you are given a text and you need to extract and classify all event triggers. An event trigger is a word or a phrase that indicates a change in state, occurrence, or activity. For example, in the sentence "Ogden Projects Inc. said net income jumped to $6.6 million", "jumped" is an event trigger that indicates a change in state.

Your output should be a list of pairs, where each pair consists of the entity (a string) and the class (a string). For example, the output for the sentence "Ogden Projects Inc. said net income jumped to $6.6 million" would be:

[
["Ogden Projects Inc.", "State"],
["net income", "Aspectual"],
["jumped", "Occurrence"],
["$6.6 million", "Intensional State"]
]

Note that the same entity can have multiple classes. For example, in the sentence "Ogden Projects, whose shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in August, closed yesterday at $26.875", "Ogden Projects" has two classes: "State" and "Reporting".

Also, note that the classes are not mutually exclusive. For example, an event trigger can be both an "Occurrence" and an "Aspectual".
