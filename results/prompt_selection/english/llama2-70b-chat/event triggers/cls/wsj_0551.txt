I'm having trouble understanding how to classify the words in the given text into the specified classes. Could you explain the reasoning behind each classification in the output?

Also, I'm curious about the meaning of "Intensional Action" and "Intensional State" classes. Could you provide examples of other words that would fall into these categories?

Lastly, are there any resources or tutorials available that can help me understand and learn about event triggers and their classification?

Thank you for your help!
