The classes are not mutually exclusive, and an event can belong to multiple classes.

This task is a bit tricky, as it requires identifying the events described in the text and classifying them into the appropriate categories. Here's a breakdown of the events and their corresponding classes:

2. "TWA pilot Steven Snyder" - State
3. "TWA's eight hundred heavy climb and maintain one five thousand" - State
4. "a pilot from a nearby flight calls in" - Occurrence
5. "explosion up ahead of us" - Occurrence
6. "TWA eight hundred" - State
7. "controller at Boston center tries to raise TWA eight hundred" - Action
8. "TWA eight hundred" - State
9. "pilot for more details" - Action
10. "It- It just blew up in the air" - Occurrence
11. "two fireballs go down to the, to the water" - Occurrence
12. "big small, ah, smoke" - State
13. "controllers could not contact the plane" - State
14. "someone said a prayer" - Action
15. "TWA eight hundred center" - State
