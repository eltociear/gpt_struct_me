Explanation:
The event triggers in this text are related to the political and military events happening in the Middle East, specifically in Israel and Lebanon. The main event is the willingness of the Israeli government to withdraw from southern Lebanon, which is an occurrence that has been developing over time and has been influenced by various factors such as the death toll of Israeli soldiers, the grassroots movement calling for withdrawal, and the signals from Syria to renew peace talks. Other events in the text include the fighting and killing of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah guerrillas, the record number of deaths in southern Lebanon, and the crash of two military helicopters en route to Lebanon. Additionally, there are mentions of the long-stalled peace talks between Israel and Syria, which could potentially be revived.

The classes used in this output are:

* State: This class represents a situation or condition that exists or persists over a period of time. It is used to describe the various political and military situations in the text, such as the Israeli government's willingness to withdraw from southern Lebanon, the death toll of Israeli soldiers, and the existence of a security buffer zone in southern Lebanon.
* Occurrence: This class represents a happening or event that takes place at a specific time or over a specific period of time. It is used to describe the various events that have occurred or are occurring in the text, such as the fighting and killing of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah guerrillas, the record number of deaths in southern Lebanon, and the crash of two military helicopters en route to Lebanon.

Note that some of the event triggers in the text may belong to more than one class. For example, the event trigger "Israeli withdrawal" could be classified as both an Occurrence (since it is a specific event that is happening or has happened) and a State (since it represents a situation or condition that exists or persists over a period of time). However, for the purpose of this task, each event trigger has been classified into only one class.
