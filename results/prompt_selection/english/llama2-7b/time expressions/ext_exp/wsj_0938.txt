"The U.S. government has decided to allow the sale of a new type of genetically engineered corn to farmers, despite concerns that it could contaminate other crops.
The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that it had approved the sale of the corn, which has been genetically altered to resist the herbicide Roundup.
The decision was made after the EPA received a petition from Monsanto Co., the company that developed the corn, asking that the product be approved for sale.
The EPA said it had concluded that the corn would not harm the environment.
The decision comes despite concerns from some farmers and environmental groups that the corn could contaminate other crops.
