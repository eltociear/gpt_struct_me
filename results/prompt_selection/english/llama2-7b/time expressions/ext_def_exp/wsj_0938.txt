"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal by a former Enron Corp. executive who was convicted of insider trading.
The justices left in place a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans that upheld the conviction of former Enron treasurer Ben Glisan Jr.
Glisan was convicted in 2002 of trading on inside information about the energy company's financial condition.
The 5th Circuit upheld Glisan's conviction in 2003, saying he had a duty to disclose the information to the public.
Glisan's attorneys had argued that the 5th Circuit's ruling was inconsistent with a 2002 Supreme Court decision that said a person who trades on inside information must have a duty to disclose the information to the public.
The Supreme Court's decision not to hear the case leaves Glisan's conviction in place.
Glisan was sentenced to 18 months in prison and ordered to pay a $100,000 fine.
He is serving his sentence at a federal prison in Beaumont, Texas.
Glisan's attorneys did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
