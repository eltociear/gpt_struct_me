"The U.S. government has decided to allow the sale of a new type of genetically engineered corn that is resistant to a common weed killer, the Agriculture Department said on Thursday. The decision by the department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is the first time the government has approved a genetically engineered crop that is resistant to a herbicide. The decision is a victory for Monsanto Co., the world's largest seed company, which has been developing the corn for more than a decade. The company said it would begin selling the corn, called Roundup Ready corn, in 1998. The corn is engineered to be resistant to the herbicide Roundup, which is made by Monsanto. The company said the corn would be available to farmers in the United States and Canada.
