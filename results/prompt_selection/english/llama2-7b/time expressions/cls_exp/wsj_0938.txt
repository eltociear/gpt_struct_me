"The U.S. government has decided to allow the sale of a new type of genetically engineered corn to farmers, despite concerns that it could contaminate other crops.
The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that it had approved the sale of the corn, which is engineered to resist the herbicide Roundup.
The decision was made after the EPA received a petition from Monsanto Co., the company that developed the corn, asking that the corn be approved for sale.
The EPA said it had concluded that the corn would not harm the environment.
The decision comes as the EPA is under fire from environmental groups for its handling of genetically engineered crops.
The groups say the EPA has been too quick to approve the sale of genetically engineered crops, and that the agency has not done enough to protect the environment from the potential harm that could result from the crops.
The EPA said it had reviewed the petition from Monsanto and concluded that the corn would not harm the environment.
The agency said it had also reviewed the petition from the National Academy of Sciences, which had concluded that the corn would not harm the environment.
