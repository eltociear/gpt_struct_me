Input:
"The U.S. government has decided to allow the sale of a new type of genetically engineered corn to farmers, the Agriculture Department said Friday. The decision to allow the sale of the corn, which is engineered to resist the herbicide Roundup, is the first time the government has approved a genetically engineered crop that is not a food or feed product. The decision was made after a 120-day review of the corn, which is made by Monsanto Co. and is called YieldGard. The government said it found no evidence that the corn poses a threat to the environment or to human health. The decision is the latest in a series of approvals for genetically engineered crops. The government has approved the sale of genetically engineered corn, soybeans, cotton and canola. The government also has approved the sale of genetically engineered salmon. The government's decision to allow the sale of the corn is likely to be challenged by environmental groups and others who say the government is not doing enough to protect the environment from genetically engineered crops. The government said it will continue to review the safety of genetically engineered crops and will make decisions on a case-by-case basis. The government said it will continue to work with farmers and other stakeholders to ensure that genetically engineered crops are safe and that they are used in a way that is consistent with the government's environmental and health goals."
