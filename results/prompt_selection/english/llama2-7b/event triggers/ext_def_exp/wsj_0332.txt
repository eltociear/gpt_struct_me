["Orkem S.A., a French state-controlled chemical manufacturer, is making a friendly bid of 470 pence ($7.43) a share for the 59.2% of U.K. specialty chemical group Coates Brothers PLC which it doesn't already own, the two sides said.",
"The offer, which values the whole of Coates at #301 million, has already been accepted by Coates executives and other shareholders owning 12.4% of the company. The acceptances give Orkem a controlling 53.2% stake in the company.",
"Orkem and Coates said last Wednesday that the two were considering a merger, through Orkem's British subsidiary, Orkem Coatings U.K. Ltd.",
"Orkem, France's third-largest chemical group, said it would fund the acquisition through internal resources. The takeover would be followed by a restructuring of Orkem's U.K. unit, including the addition of related Orkem businesses and possibly further acquisitions. Orkem said it eventually would seek to make a public share offering in its U.K. business."]

Explanation:
The event triggers are the sentences that start with a capital letter.

## Solution

```python
import json

with open('input.txt') as f:
    data = json.loads(f.read())

events = [x.strip() for x in data if x.startswith(' ')]

print(events)
```

## Explanation

The `json.loads` function parses the input as JSON and returns a Python dictionary.

The `data` variable is a dictionary, where the keys are the lines of the input and the values are the lines themselves.

The `x.startswith(' ')` condition checks if the string `x` starts with a space character.

The `x.strip()` function removes the leading and trailing whitespace characters from the string `x`.

The `print` function prints the list of strings `events`.
