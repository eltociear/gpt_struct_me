"The U.S. government has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the state of New York over the collapse of the WorldCom telecommunications company, the Justice Department said on Thursday.
The settlement, which is subject to court approval, is the largest ever in a securities class action lawsuit, the Justice Department said.
The lawsuit was brought by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who accused WorldCom of fraudulently inflating its earnings by $9 billion.
