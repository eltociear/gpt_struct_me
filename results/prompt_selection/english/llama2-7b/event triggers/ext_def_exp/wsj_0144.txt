["Travelers Corp.'s third-quarter net income rose 11%, even though claims stemming from Hurricane Hugo reduced results $40 million.
Net advanced to $94.2 million, or 89 cents a share, from $85 million, or 83 cents a share, including net realized investment gains of $31 million, up from $10 million a year ago. But revenue declined to $3 billion from $3.2 billion.
Travelers estimated that the California earthquake last month will result in a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of less than $10 million.
The insurer's earnings from commercial property/casualty lines fell 59% in the latest quarter, while it lost $7.2 million in its personal property/casualty business, compared with earnings of $6.1 million a year ago.
Travelers's employee benefits group, which includes its group health insurance operations, posted earnings of $24 million, compared with a loss of $3 million last year.
In the first nine months, net was $306 million, compared with a loss of $195 million in the 1988 period. The year-ago results included a $415 million charge in the 1988 second quarter for underperforming real estate and mortgage loans."

"The U.S. government has decided to allow the sale of a new type of genetically engineered corn that is resistant to a common weed killer.
The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that it has approved the sale of the corn, which is engineered to resist the herbicide Roundup.
The decision is a victory for Monsanto Co., which has been trying to sell the corn for several years.
The company says the corn will help farmers reduce their use of Roundup, which is made by Monsanto.
The EPA said it has determined that the corn is not likely to cause harm to the environment.
The agency said it will continue to monitor the corn to make sure it is not harmful to the environment.
The decision comes as the EPA is under pressure to approve more genetically engineered crops.
The agency has approved the sale of genetically engineered corn, soybeans and cotton.
The EPA has also approved the sale of genetically engineered potatoes and apples.
The EPA said it will continue to monitor the corn to make sure it is not harmful to the environment."
