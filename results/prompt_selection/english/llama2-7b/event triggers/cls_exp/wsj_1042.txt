Input:
"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid by the state of Texas to block a federal law that allows the government to seize the assets of people suspected of terrorism. The court, in a brief order, denied a request by Texas Attorney General John Cornyn to block the law, which was passed by Congress in 2001. The law allows the government to seize the assets of people suspected of terrorism, even if they are not charged with a crime. The law was challenged by Texas and other states, which argued that it violates the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to hear the case. The law was passed in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States. It was designed to help the government seize the assets of people suspected of terrorism, even if they are not charged with a crime. The law has been used to seize the assets of people suspected of terrorism, including the assets of people who have not been charged with a crime. The law has been criticized by civil liberties groups, who argue that it violates the Constitution's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures. The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to hear the case."
