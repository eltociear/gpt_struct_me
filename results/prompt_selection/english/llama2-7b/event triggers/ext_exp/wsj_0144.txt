"The U.S. government has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the state of New York over the 1987 stock market crash.
The settlement, announced Monday, is the largest ever in a securities class action.
The suit was brought by New York Attorney General Robert Abrams in 1988, alleging that the nation's largest brokerage firms had engaged in illegal short-selling of stocks.
Short-selling is the practice of borrowing shares of stock and selling them, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price.
The settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge, will be divided among investors who bought or sold stocks between Jan. 1, 1985, and Dec. 31, 1987.
The settlement also requires the brokerage firms to pay $100 million to the state of New York to cover legal fees.
The settlement is the latest in a series of lawsuits brought by state attorneys general against the brokerage firms.
In 1993, the firms agreed to pay $1.4 billion to settle a similar suit brought by the attorneys general of 19 states.
The firms also agreed to pay $1.02 billion to settle a suit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The settlements were the largest ever in securities class actions.
The settlements were the largest ever in securities class actions."
