"The U.S. government has agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle a lawsuit brought by the state of New York over the 1993 crash of TWA Flight 800, which killed 230 people.
The settlement, announced Monday, ends a 10-year legal battle over the cause of the crash.
The government had argued that the crash was caused by a mechanical failure.
But New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said the settlement was a victory for the families of the victims.
``This settlement is a victory for the families of the victims of TWA Flight 800,'' Spitzer said. ``It is a victory for the people of New York.''
The settlement ends a lawsuit filed by New York in 1997, which alleged that the government had failed to properly investigate the crash.
