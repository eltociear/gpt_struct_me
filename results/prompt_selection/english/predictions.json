            "JERUSALEM (AP)_ Top Israeli officials sent strong new signals Sunday that Israel wants to withdraw from southern Lebanon, where a costly war of attrition has been steadily claiming soldiers' lives. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel was willing to withdraw from southern Lebanon provided Israel's northern frontier could be secured. \"If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of U.N. Resolution 425,\" Netanyahu told his ministers. That 1978 resolution calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the self-declared security zone it occupies in south Lebanon, and for the deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to ensure security along the Lebanese-Israeli border. On Friday, Netanyahu said he had \"no qualms\" about implementing the U.N. resolution, as long as Israel had \"the necessary security safeguards.\" Cabinet minister Michael Eitan said Sunday that Netanyahu's remarks marked a substantive change in Israel's position. \"We will defend our north from the international border,\" said Eitan, the science minister. \"No one wants to stay in Lebanon; thus we think it better to withdraw.\" Uri Lubrani, Israel's top official for Lebanon affairs, also suggested Israel was willing to modify its political goals in Lebanon. \"This is a new thing...it means that we are willing to talk today _ full stop _ about security,\" Lubrani told Israel's Channel One. \"We have gotten off the issue of peace, off the issue of normalization.\" As the death toll in Lebanon has mounted, the Israeli government has been faced with a growing grassroots movement calling for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. Since 1985 _ when the Israelis created a security buffer zone southern Lebanon _ nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed fighting Hezbollah and other guerrillas. Last week, Hezbollah fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded six others. The Israelis suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon last year. In addition, 73 soldiers were killed en route to Lebanon when two military helicopters crashed last February. The Maariv newspaper said Sunday that Netanyahu's comments last week were in response to signals from Syria that it wants to renew the long-stalled peace talks between the two countries. The newspaper, quoting \"secret reports,\" said Syria had indicated its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture to a closed forum in Baltimore. Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday, apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said. Israel-Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli official to refer to U.N. resolution 425 in a speech six weeks ago, saying at the time he was willing to withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that Israel would not be attacked."

            "JERUSALEM (AP)_ Top Israeli officials sent strong new signals Sunday that Israel wants to withdraw from southern Lebanon, where a costly war of attrition has been steadily claiming soldiers' lives. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel was willing to withdraw from southern Lebanon provided Israel's northern frontier could be secured. \"If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of U.N. Resolution 425,\" Netanyahu told his ministers. That 1978 resolution calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the self-declared security zone it occupies in south Lebanon, and for the deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to ensure security along the Lebanese-Israeli border. On Friday, Netanyahu said he had \"no qualms\" about implementing the U.N. resolution, as long as Israel had \"the necessary security safeguards.\" Cabinet minister Michael Eitan said Sunday that Netanyahu's remarks marked a substantive change in Israel's position. \"We will defend our north from the international border,\" said Eitan, the science minister. \"No one wants to stay in Lebanon; thus we think it better to withdraw.\" Uri Lubrani, Israel's top official for Lebanon affairs, also suggested Israel was willing to modify its political goals in Lebanon. \"This is a new thing...it means that we are willing to talk today _ full stop _ about security,\" Lubrani told Israel's Channel One. \"We have gotten off the issue of peace, off the issue of normalization.\" As the death toll in Lebanon has mounted, the Israeli government has been faced with a growing grassroots movement calling for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. Since 1985 _ when the Israelis created a security buffer zone southern Lebanon _ nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed fighting Hezbollah and other guerrillas. Last week, Hezbollah fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded six others. The Israelis suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon last year. In addition, 73 soldiers were killed en route to Lebanon when two military helicopters crashed last February. The Maariv newspaper said Sunday that Netanyahu's comments last week were in response to signals from Syria that it wants to renew the long-stalled peace talks between the two countries. The newspaper, quoting \"secret reports,\" said Syria had indicated its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture to a closed forum in Baltimore. Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday, apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said. Israel-Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli official to refer to U.N. resolution 425 in a speech six weeks ago, saying at the time he was willing to withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that Israel would not be attacked."

The establishment of the separate company, to be called Courtaulds Textiles, could be effective as early as next year's first quarter.",

Courtaulds' restructuring is among the largest thus far in Britain, though it is dwarfed by B.A.T Industries PLC's plans to spin roughly off #4 billion in assets to help fend off a takeover bid from Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith. The divested Courtaulds textile operations had operating profit of #50 million on #980 million in revenue in the year ended March 31.",

            "JERUSALEM (AP)_ Top Israeli officials sent strong new signals Sunday that Israel wants to withdraw from southern Lebanon, where a costly war of attrition has been steadily claiming soldiers' lives. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel was willing to withdraw from southern Lebanon provided Israel's northern frontier could be secured. \"If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of U.N. Resolution 425,\" Netanyahu told his ministers. That 1978 resolution calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the self-declared security zone it occupies in south Lebanon, and for the deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to ensure security along the Lebanese-Israeli border. On Friday, Netanyahu said he had \"no qualms\" about implementing the U.N. resolution, as long as Israel had \"the necessary security safeguards.\" Cabinet minister Michael Eitan said Sunday that Netanyahu's remarks marked a substantive change in Israel's position. \"We will defend our north from the international border,\" said Eitan, the science minister. \"No one wants to stay in Lebanon; thus we think it better to withdraw.\" Uri Lubrani, Israel's top official for Lebanon affairs, also suggested Israel was willing to modify its political goals in Lebanon. \"This is a new thing...it means that we are willing to talk today _ full stop _ about security,\" Lubrani told Israel's Channel One. \"We have gotten off the issue of peace, off the issue of normalization.\" As the death toll in Lebanon has mounted, the Israeli government has been faced with a growing grassroots movement calling for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. Since 1985 _ when the Israelis created a security buffer zone southern Lebanon _ nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed fighting Hezbollah and other guerrillas. Last week, Hezbollah fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded six others. The Israelis suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon last year. In addition, 73 soldiers were killed en route to Lebanon when two military helicopters crashed last February. The Maariv newspaper said Sunday that Netanyahu's comments last week were in response to signals from Syria that it wants to renew the long-stalled peace talks between the two countries. The newspaper, quoting \"secret reports,\" said Syria had indicated its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture to a closed forum in Baltimore. Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday, apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said. Israel-Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli official to refer to U.N. resolution 425 in a speech six weeks ago, saying at the time he was willing to withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that Israel would not be attacked."

            "JERUSALEM (AP)_ Top Israeli officials sent strong new signals Sunday that Israel wants to withdraw from southern Lebanon, where a costly war of attrition has been steadily claiming soldiers' lives. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his Cabinet on Sunday that Israel was willing to withdraw from southern Lebanon provided Israel's northern frontier could be secured. \"If the Lebanese government will cooperate with us in making appropriate security arrangements in south Lebanon, we will be happy to get out of Lebanon in the framework of implementation of U.N. Resolution 425,\" Netanyahu told his ministers. That 1978 resolution calls for Israel's unconditional withdrawal from the self-declared security zone it occupies in south Lebanon, and for the deployment of the Lebanese army and U.N. forces to ensure security along the Lebanese-Israeli border. On Friday, Netanyahu said he had \"no qualms\" about implementing the U.N. resolution, as long as Israel had \"the necessary security safeguards.\" Cabinet minister Michael Eitan said Sunday that Netanyahu's remarks marked a substantive change in Israel's position. \"We will defend our north from the international border,\" said Eitan, the science minister. \"No one wants to stay in Lebanon; thus we think it better to withdraw.\" Uri Lubrani, Israel's top official for Lebanon affairs, also suggested Israel was willing to modify its political goals in Lebanon. \"This is a new thing...it means that we are willing to talk today _ full stop _ about security,\" Lubrani told Israel's Channel One. \"We have gotten off the issue of peace, off the issue of normalization.\" As the death toll in Lebanon has mounted, the Israeli government has been faced with a growing grassroots movement calling for Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. Since 1985 _ when the Israelis created a security buffer zone southern Lebanon _ nearly 200 Israeli soldiers have been killed fighting Hezbollah and other guerrillas. Last week, Hezbollah fighters killed three Israeli soldiers and seriously wounded six others. The Israelis suffered a record 39 deaths in southern Lebanon last year. In addition, 73 soldiers were killed en route to Lebanon when two military helicopters crashed last February. The Maariv newspaper said Sunday that Netanyahu's comments last week were in response to signals from Syria that it wants to renew the long-stalled peace talks between the two countries. The newspaper, quoting \"secret reports,\" said Syria had indicated its interest in resuming talks in remarks made last week by the Syrian ambassador to Washington, Walid Mualem, in a lecture to a closed forum in Baltimore. Two top aides to Netanyahu, political adviser Uzi Arad and Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh, left for Europe on Sunday, apparently to investigate the Syrian issue, the newspaper said. Israel-Syrian talks have been cut off for nearly two years. Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai was the first senior Israeli official to refer to U.N. resolution 425 in a speech six weeks ago, saying at the time he was willing to withdraw troops in exchange for guarantees that Israel would not be attacked."

By comparison, for the first nine months, Xerox earned $492 million, or $4.55 a share, on revenue of $12.97 billion.Earnings at Xerox's financial-services operations actually rose slightly, but that was largely because capital gains at Crum amp Forster offset Hurricane Hugo payments and the reserves set up to cover future payments.Property/casualty insurance has been a tough business in recent quarters, as pricing has been cutthroat and natural disasters such as Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake have resulted in huge payments."

            "The board said Mr. Drabinsky and Vice Chairman Myron Gottlieb are negotiating financing before offering C$16.40 a share to acquire all of Cineplex's shares outstanding.",
            "The directors added that the two executives haven't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid",
            "until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders.",
            "The directors said if Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb mail an offer to shareholders by Nov. 22, it will reimburse them a maximum of C$8.5 million for expenses related to a bid.",
            "We consider that his bid is an acceptable bid",
            "MCA and Cineplex's other major shareholder, Montreal-based financier Charles Bronfman and his associates, have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by Mr. Drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder.",
            "Ms. Kolber said the committee had received other bids.",
            "She declined to identify other bidders but said Mr. Drabinsky's offer is all cash, and it's for all of the company.",
            "Several Cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either disappointingly low or for only part of the company.",
            "If a bid materializes at that price, shareholders will have every reason to be glad, but the question of financing still remains.",
            "Last April, Mr. Drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to 30.2% of Cineplex for C$17.50 a share from Bronfman associates.",
            "Mr. Drabinsky, who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years, said the purchase, subsequently rejected by regulators, was aimed at consolidating his control of the company.",
            "The directors didn't indicate the source of financing for Mr. Drabinsky's new proposal",
            "but said MCA and the Bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $57 million and then lease back to Cineplex its 18-screen theater complex in Universal City, Calif., if Mr. Drabinsky succeeds in an offer.",
            "This is being done at the suggestion of {Mr. Drabinsky} and to accommodate him, to facilitate his financing arrangements",
            "In addition, the directors said if a bid by Mr. Drabinsky is successful, Cineplex expects Rank Organisation PLC to acquire the 51% of Cineplex's Film House unit it doesn't own, and provide Mr. Drabinsky with additional loan financing.",
            "Michael Gifford, Rank's chief executive, said the British theater chain's total involvement wouldn't exceed $100 million",
            "Cineplex shareholders responded coolly to yesterday's announcement.",
            "In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed at $11, down 25 cents, with more than a million shares changing hands.",
            "On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Cineplex closed at C$12.875, off 37.5 Canadian cents, well below the C$16.40 level.",
            "Where's the bid? asked Pierre Panet-Raymond, an analyst and broker with Toronto securities dealer McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd.",
            "Mr. Panet-Raymond said he doesn't think Messrs. Drabinsky and Gottlieb are anywhere close to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again.",
            "Mr. Drabinsky couldn't be reached for comment."
