Explanation:
* "early this week" is a Duration expression, as it refers to a short period of time.
* "first nine months" is a Time expression, as it refers to a specific period of time (9 months).
* "next three quarters" is a Duration expression, as it refers to a longer period of time (3 quarters).
* "Hurricane Hugo" and "California earthquake" are Event expressions, as they refer to specific, notable events.

Note:
* The output is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the entity and the class.
* The entity is the time expression, and the class is the category of time expression (Date, Time, Duration, or Event).
