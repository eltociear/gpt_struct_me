Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions, including dates, times, and duration. The task is to extract and classify these time expressions into their respective classes.
The output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.
For example, the output for the first time expression "Orkem S.A., a French state-controlled chemical manufacturer, is making a friendly bid of 470 pence ($7.43) a share for the 59.2% of U.K. specialty chemical group Coates Brothers PLC which it doesn't already own, the two sides said." would be:
{
"Orkem S.A.",
"Date"
}

Note:
* The input text may contain multiple time expressions, and each expression should be extracted and classified separately.
* The classes "Date", "Time", and "Duration" are mutually exclusive, and an entity can only belong to one class.
* The class "Set" is used to indicate that the entity is a geographical location.
