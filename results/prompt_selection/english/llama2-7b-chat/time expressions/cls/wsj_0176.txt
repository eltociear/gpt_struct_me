Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions, including dates, times, and durations. The task is to extract and classify these time expressions into their respective classes.
The output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second string is the class.
In this case, the output list contains three elements:
* The first element represents Xerox Corp, with a date of "2019, Q3" and a class of "Date".
* The second element represents Crum amp Forster, with a date of "2019, Q3" and a class of "Set".
* The third element represents Xerox Corp, with a time of "2019, 9 months" and a class of "Duration".
* The fourth element represents Crum amp Forster, with a time of "2019, Q3" and a class of "Set".
Note that the output list only includes the time expressions that are mentioned in the input text.
