Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions, which are extracted and classified as follows:
* "next year's first quarter": Date (class = Date)
* "March 31": Date (class = Date)
* "1 year": Duration (class = Duration)
* "#300 million - #400 million": Money (class = Money)
* "#1.44 billion": Money (class = Money)
* "5% - 10%": Duration (class = Duration)
* "small stakes": Money (class = Money)

Note that the output list is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second string is the class.
