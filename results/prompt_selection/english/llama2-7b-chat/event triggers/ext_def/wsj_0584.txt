Event triggers:
1. "The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp."
2. "The amended pact shows how McCaw's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner, forcing huge debt on the proposed new company."
3. "The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth's and to spin off its broadcasting operations."
4. "Under new terms of the agreement, announced Friday, LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger."
5. "In addition, New York-based LIN would exercise its right to buy out for $1.9 billion the 55% equity interest of its partner, Metromedia Co., in a New York cellular franchise."
6. "McCaw has forced LIN's hand by bidding $1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month."
7. "We're taking on more debt than we would have liked to," acknowledged Michael Plouf, LIN's vice president and treasurer."
8. "Analyst estimate the value of the BellSouth proposal at about $115 to $125 a share."
9. "McCaw's bid also has a similar clause. Only McCaw's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices."
10. "To mollify shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the BellSouth-LIN agreement, BellSouth also agreed to pay as much as $10 a share, or $540 million, if, after five years, the trading value of the new cellular company isn't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the McCaw offer."
11. "BellSouth's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts, especially because of the company's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings."
12. "For 1988, BellSouth earned $1.7 billion, or $3.51 a share, on revenue of $13.6 billion."
13. "In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth shares fell 87.5 cents to $52.125."
14. "In national over-the-counter trading, LIN shares soared $4.625 to closed at $112.625, while McCaw fell $2.50 a share to $37.75."
15. "The proposed BellSouth-LIN cellular company, including the newly acquired Metromedia stake, would give the new entity 55 million potential customers, including about 35 million in the nation's top 10 markets."
