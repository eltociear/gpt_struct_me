Explanation:
The output is a list of JSON-parseable objects, where each object represents an event trigger and has two strings as properties: "entity" and "class". The "entity" property contains the name of the entity that is involved in the trigger, while the "class" property contains the class of the trigger.
The classes used in this output are:
* State: Triggers related to the current state of the entity, such as "Di Giorgio Corp." being in a state of continuing talks.
* Aspectual: Triggers related to the aspect or attribute of the entity, such as "certain units" or "individual units".
* Intensional Action: Triggers related to the intentions or actions of the entity, such as "Di Giorgio Corp." seeking alternatives to an unsolicited tender offer.
* Person: Triggers related to the people involved in the event, such as "Robert Mellor".
Note: The class labels are not mutually exclusive, and some triggers may belong to multiple classes. For example, "Robert Mellor" could be both a "Person" and an "Intensional Action" trigger, as he is both a person involved in the event and the one taking an action.
