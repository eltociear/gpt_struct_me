JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.

Input:
"The U.S. government is considering a plan to sell off the nation's 100 million-plus acres of federal land, a move that would raise billions of dollars for the Treasury but would also spark a political firestorm.
The proposal, which is being considered by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, would be the largest sale of federal land in U.S. history.
The plan would be to sell off the land in parcels of 100,000 acres or more, with the proceeds going to the Treasury.
The land would be sold to the highest bidder, with the government retaining the right to buy back the land at a later date.
The plan is being considered as a way to raise money for the federal government, which is facing a budget deficit of more than $200 billion.
The sale of the land would be a one-time event, and the government would not sell off any more land in the future.
The plan is being opposed by environmental groups, who say it would lead to the destruction of valuable wildlife habitat.
The plan is also being opposed by some members of Congress, who say it would be a bad idea to sell off land that is owned by the American people."
