"The United States and its allies are preparing for a possible war with Iraq. The U.S. has sent 38,000 troops to the Persian Gulf. The U.S. has also sent a naval armada to the Gulf. The U.S. has said it will strike Iraq unless it gives the U.N. arms inspectors unfettered access to all potential weapons sites, including Saddam's palaces. Iraq had argued the presidential sites should be off limits as symbols of sovereignty. A Pentagon spokesman said Thursday that the 38,000 U.S. troops in the Gulf will remain until Iraq complies with the U.N. Security Council agreement over weapons inspections. ``We are going to maintain our forces in the region for the foreseeable future,'' said spokesman Kenneth Bacon. The U.N.-Iraq accord was worked out by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who appointed a retired Indian diplomat on Thursday as his special representative to Iraq. Prakash Shah, 58, a former Indian ambassador to the United Nations, is part of an effort by Annan to expand contacts with the Iraqi leadership. Palace inspections are not expected to start until the new agreement's procedures are in place. U.N. officials in New York on Friday finished drafting the rules, in consultation with Iraqi diplomats. The procedures are due to go before the Security Council next week. The Security Council has said it will not lift the sweeping sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait until the U.N. inspectors certify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction."
