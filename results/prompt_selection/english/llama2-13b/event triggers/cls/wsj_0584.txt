  ["Moreover, the amended pact shows how McCaw's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner, forcing huge debt on the proposed new company. The debt, estimated at $4.7 billion, could mortgage the cellular company's future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term.", "Moreover, the amended pact shows how McCaw's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner, forcing huge debt on the proposed new company.

  ["The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth's and to spin off its broadcasting operations. But under new terms of the agreement, announced Friday, LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger. LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend, but commitments from banks still haven't been obtained.

  ["McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4% of LIN's stock. In response to BellSouth's amended pact, the Kirkland, Wash., company extended its own offer to buy 22 million LIN shares for $125 apiece, which would give McCaw a 50.3% controlling interest. Over the weekend, McCaw continued to call for an auction of LIN. Analysts said they expect McCaw to escalate the bidding again.", "McCaw, the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the U.S., already owns about 9.4% of LIN's
