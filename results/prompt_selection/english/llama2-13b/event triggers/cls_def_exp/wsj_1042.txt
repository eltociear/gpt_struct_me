"The U.S. government is considering a plan to sell off its remaining stake in the Chrysler Corp. and use the proceeds to help pay for the federal budget deficit, a newspaper reported Sunday. The New York Times said the plan, which is being considered by the Treasury Department, would involve selling off the government's 11 percent stake in Chrysler, which is now worth about $1.5 billion. The government has owned the stake since 1980, when it bailed out the automaker. The Times said the plan is being considered as a way to help pay for the federal budget deficit, which is expected to reach $290 billion this year. The government has been selling off its stake in Chrysler in small increments over the past several years. In 1998, the government sold off its remaining 10 percent stake in the company for $1.3 billion. The Times said the government is considering selling off its remaining stake in Chrysler in one or more large blocks. The government would likely sell the stake through a public offering, the newspaper said.
