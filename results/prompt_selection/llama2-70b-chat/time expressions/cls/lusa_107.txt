[
["12:50", "Time"],
["hoje", "Date"],
["cerca de uma semana", "Duration"],
["já", "Set"]
]

Explanation:
The input text contains four time expressions: "12:50", "hoje", "cerca de uma semana", and "já".

* "12:50" is a time expression that can be classified as "Time".
* "hoje" is a date expression that can be classified as "Date".
* "cerca de uma semana" is a duration expression that can be classified as "Duration".
* "já" is a set expression that can be classified as "Set".

Therefore, the output should be a JSON-parseable list with four elements, each containing the time expression and its corresponding class.
