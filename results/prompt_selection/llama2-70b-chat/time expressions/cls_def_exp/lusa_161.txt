["hoje", "Date"],

["10 anos", "Duration"],
["20 anos", "Duration"],
["10", "Set"]
]

Explanation:
The input text contains several temporal expressions:

* "hoje" (today) is a date expression and should be classified as such.
* "10:30" is a time expression and should be classified as such.
* "10 anos" (10 years) is a duration expression and should be classified as such.
* "20 anos" (20 years) is also a duration expression and should be classified as such.
* "10" (10) is a set expression, as it represents a specific quantity, and should be classified as such.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list of tuples, where each tuple contains the temporal expression and its corresponding class.
