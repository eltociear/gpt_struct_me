Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different language and a different set of classes. As before, the goal is to extract and classify all participants in the given text.

The classes in this task are:

* Person: A person, including their name, age, or any other relevant information.
* Organization: A company, institution, or any other organization.
* Object: A physical object or a concept.
* Location: A place, including its name, address, or any other relevant information.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as a mountain, river, or animal.
* Facility: A man-made structure or installation, such as a building, road, or bridge.
* Other: Any other entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second is the class.

For example, in the given input text, "Homem" (Man) would be classified as "Person", and "Vila Nova de Gaia" (Vila Nova de Gaia) would be classified as "Location".
