Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each entity in the text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person or group of people.
* Organization: A company, organization, or institution.
* Object: A physical object or entity.
* Location: A geographical location.
* Nature: A natural entity, such as an animal or plant.
* Facility: A building or structure.
* Other: Any entity that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a list of entities, where each entity is represented as a list with two elements: the entity itself, and its corresponding class.

For example, in the given input text, "GNR" is a person, so it should be classified as such, and "Aveiro" is a location, so it should be classified as such. "77 quilos de atum-rabilho" is an object, and "condutor do veículo" is a person.

The task is to classify all entities in the input text into the corresponding classes.
