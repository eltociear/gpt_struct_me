Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different focus. This time, the goal is to extract and classify all participants in a given text. The participants can be individuals, groups, organizations, or other entities that are actively involved in or impacted by an event or state. The classes are:

* Person: Individuals, such as the man who committed the crime or the victim.
* Organization: Groups or institutions, such as the GNR or the Polícia Judiciária.
* Location: Places where the event occurred, such as Vila Nova de Gaia or the Rua da Figueirinha.
* Object: Items that are relevant to the event, such as the weapon used in the crime.
* Nature: Natural elements that are relevant to the event, such as the time of day or the weather.
* Facility: Buildings or structures that are relevant to the event, such as a hospital or a prison.
* Other: Any other entities that are relevant to the event but do not fit into the above categories, such as a vehicle or a piece of evidence.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings: the entity and the class. For example, ["Homem", "Person"] or ["GNR", "Organization"]".
