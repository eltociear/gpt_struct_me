Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different focus. Here, we need to extract and classify all participants mentioned in the text, including people, organizations, locations, and other entities. The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string represents the entity, and the second string represents the class.

The classes we need to use are:

* Person: Individuals, such as the 34-year-old man who was found dead.
* Organization: Groups or companies, such as Transportadora J Amaral, GNR, Lusa, Bombeiros de Estarreja, Polícia Judiciária, and Viatura Médica de Emergência e Reanimação de Aveiro.
* Location: Places, such as Estarreja, the cisterna (where the man was found dead), and the Hospital Infante D. Pedro.
* Nature: Natural entities, such as the cisterna.
* Facility: Buildings or structures, such as the Hospital Infante D. Pedro.
* Other: Any other entities that don't fit into the above categories, such as the transporte (transport) mentioned in the text.

Note that some entities may fit into more than one category. For example, the "Bombeiros de Estarreja" could be classified as both an organization and a facility, depending on the context.

As before, the input text is in Portuguese, so make sure to use appropriate language models and resources for this task.
