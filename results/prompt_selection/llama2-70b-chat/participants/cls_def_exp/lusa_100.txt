Explanation:
The input text describes a situation where a man has been arrested for domestic violence against his ex-partner. The participants in this situation are:

* The man (39 years old), who is the suspected perpetrator of the violence and is now under electronic surveillance.
* The ex-partner (42 years old), who is the victim of the violence and has been granted a restraining order.
* The GNR (National Republican Guard), which is the organization responsible for enforcing the law and maintaining public order.
* Penafiel, which is the location where the events took place.
* The separation, which is the reason for the man's violent behavior.
*The panic button, which is an object that the victim has been using for protection.
* Teleassistência, which is a facility that provides remote assistance and support.
* The man's criminal record, which is relevant to the situation but does not fit into any of the other categories.

Therefore, the output is a list of eight elements, each consisting of a participant entity and its corresponding class.
