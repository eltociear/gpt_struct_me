Note:
The input text is in Portuguese.

This task is similar to the previous one, but with a different input text and classes. Your goal is to extract and classify all participants in the given text.

You can use the same approach as before, but you'll need to adjust the rules to match the new classes and inputtext.

Here's a hint to get you started:

1. Start by identifying the entities in the text. You can use a technique like named entity recognition to help you identify them.
2. Once you have a list of entities, you can start classifying them into the different classes.
3. Use a combination of rules and heuristics to determine the class of each entity. For example, you can use the context in which the entity appears to help determine its class.
4. Test your approach on a few examples to make sure it's working correctly.
5. Finally, output the list of classified entities in the format specified in the task.

Good luck! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
