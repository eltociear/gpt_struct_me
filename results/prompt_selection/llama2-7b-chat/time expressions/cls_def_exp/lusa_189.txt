* "não adiantando" is a duration expression, indicating that the incident occurred without warning.

Note:
* The output is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. Thefirst string is the entity, and the second string is the class.
* The classes are defined as follows:
	+ Date: A date expression represents a specific point in time, such as a birthday or anniversary.
	+ Time: A time expression represents a specific time of day, such as 9:00 AM or 5:00 PM.
	+ Duration: A duration expression represents a specific amount of time, such as 30 seconds or 2 hours.
	+ Set: A set expression represents a category or group of things, such as a set of colors or a set of numbers. In this case, the set expression "suspeita" indicates that the incident is being investigated as a suspected homicide.
