'm trying to extract the participants from the JSON file.
I've tried to use the following code:
import json

with open('data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

for participant in data['participants']:
    print(participant)

But it doesn't work.
 @Barmar I've tried to use the following code: `with open('data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

for participant in data['participants']:
    print(participant)` `data['participants']` is a list, not a dictionary. I've tried to use the following code: `with open('data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)

for participant in data['participants']:
    print(participant)` `data['participants']` is a list, not a dictionary. I've tried to use the following code: `with open('data.json') as f:
