Note:
Please note that the input text is in Portuguese.

This task is a good example of a typical NLP task, where the goal is to extract specific information from a text. In this case, the task is to extract all event triggers, which are the phrases that describe events that occurred or will occur in the text.

The output should be a list of strings, where each string represents an event trigger.The list should be in JSON format, which is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy to read and write.

The input text is in Portuguese, so you may need to use a Portuguese language model or dictionary to help with the task. Additionally, you may need to use techniques such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing to identify the event triggers in the text.

Overall, this task is a good opportunity to practice your NLP skills and to learn more about working with text data.
