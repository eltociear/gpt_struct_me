Note:
The output format is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.

The classes are:

* State: refers to any state, situation or condition.
* Occurrence: refers to any occurrence, incident, action or event.
* Reporting: refers to any reporting, description or narration of an event or state.
* Perception: refers to any perception, understanding or interpretation of an event or state.
* Aspectual: refers to any aspectual information, such as the time or the way something happens.
* Intensional Action: refers to any action or activity that is intended or planned.
* Intensional State: refers to any state or situation that is intended or planned.

The task is to extract and classify all event triggers in the given text. Event triggers are the words or phrases that indicate the occurrence of an event or a change in state. They can be verbs, nouns, adjectives or adverbs that convey a sense of time, manner, or cause and effect.

For example, in the sentence "The man was shot dead", "shot" is an event trigger that indicates the occurrence of a violent event, and "dead" is a state trigger that indicates the result of that event. In the sentence "The dog ran away", "ran" is an event trigger that indicates the occurrence of a movement event, and "away" is a state trigger that indicates the result of that event.

Your output should be a list of all event triggers in the text, along with their corresponding class labels. The class labels should be chosen from the list of classes provided above.

Note that some words or phrases may have multiple meanings or functions in different contexts. You should use your judgment to determine the appropriate class label based on the context in which the word or phrase appears.

Also, note that some event triggers may be ambiguous or have multiple possible class labels. In such cases, you should choose the most appropriate class label based on the context and the specific meaning of the word or phrase in that context.
