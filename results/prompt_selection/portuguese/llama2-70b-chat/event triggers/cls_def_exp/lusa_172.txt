Note:
The output is a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class. The classes are:

* State: refers to a state of being or a condition.
* Occurrence: refers to an event or a happening.
* Aspectual: refers to an aspect or a feature of an event.
* Intensional Action: refers to an action that is intended or planned.
* Intensional State: refers to a state that is intended or planned.
* Reporting: refers to a report or a description of an event.

In this task, you are given a text in Portuguese and you must extract and classify all event triggers. Event triggers are words or phrases that indicate the occurrence of an event. For example, in the text given, "encontrado" (found) isan event trigger that indicates the occurrence of an event.

You must classify each event trigger into one of the seven classes mentioned above. For example, "encontrado" (found) would be classified as an "Occurrence".

You must output a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity (the word or phrase that triggered the event) and the second is the class.

Note that some events may have multiple triggers. For example, in the text given, "terá alegadamente caído" (he will have allegedly fallen) is also an event trigger that indicates the occurrence of the same event as "encontrado" (found). In such cases, you must output multiple pairs, one for each trigger, with the same class for all pairs that correspond to the same event.

You must also note that some events may have multiple classes. For example, "foi ativada a Estação Salva-vidas de Ferragudo" (the Ferragudo Lifeguard Station was activated) is an event that could be classified as both "Occurrence" and "Reporting".
