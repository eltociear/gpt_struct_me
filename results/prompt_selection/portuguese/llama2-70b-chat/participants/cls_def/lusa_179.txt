Note:
The input text is in Portuguese, but the task is to classify the participants in English.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to assign a class to each participant mentioned in the input text. The classes are:

* Person: A person who is actively involved in the event or situation.
* Organization: A group or entity that is actively involved in the event or situation.
* Location: A place where the event or situation occurs.
* Object: An object or item that is relevant to the event or situation.
* Nature: Anatural phenomenon or force that is relevant to the event or situation.
* Facility: A building or structure that is relevant to the event or situation.
* Other: Any other participant that does not fit into the above categories.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second is the class.
