Note:
The input text is in Portuguese. The output should be in English.

This task is a classification task, where the goal is to classify each participant mentioned in the input text into one of the predefined classes. The classes are:

* Person: A person or group of people, such as a victim, actor, or observer.
* Organization: A group or entity that is involved in the situation, such as a company, government agency, or non-profit organization.
* Object: A physical object or entity that is involved in the situation, such as a boat, car, or building.
* Location: A physical location where the situation occurred or is taking place, such as a city, country, or landmark.
* Nature: A natural entity or phenomenon that is involved in the situation, such as a storm, earthquake, or wildfire.
* Facility: A man-made structure or entity that is involved in the situation, such as a hospital, school, or prison.
* Other: Any other entity or concept that does not fit into one of the above categories.

The input text is in Portuguese, so the model should be able to handle language translation as well. The output should be a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity, and the second string is the class.
