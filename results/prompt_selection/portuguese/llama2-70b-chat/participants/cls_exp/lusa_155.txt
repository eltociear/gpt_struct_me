Note:
The output is a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class. The classes are the ones you defined.

This task is a classic example of named entity recognition and classification. The goal is to identify and classify all the entities in the given text into predefined categories.

The input textis in Portuguese, and it describes a news story about a man who was injured after being attacked with a bottle in a restaurant in Palmela. The text also mentions the location of the restaurant, the name of the city, and the organization that the victim belongs to.

Your task is to write a code that can extract and classify all the entities in the input text into the following classes:

* Person
* Organization
* Object
* Location
* Nature
* Facility
* Other

The output should be a list of pairs, where each pair contains the entity and its corresponding class.

Here's an example of how the output should look like:

[
["Homem", "Person"],
["restaurante", "Facility"],
["Palmela", "Location"],
["Cajados", "Location"],
["Setúbal", "Location"],
["GNR", "Organization"],
["Lusa", "Organization"],
["São Bernardo", "Facility"],
["mulher", "Person"],
["automóvel", "Object"],
["bebidas alcoólicas","Object"],
["álcool", "Object"],
["via pública", "Location"],
["Comando Distrital de Operações de Socorro", "Organization"],
["Setúbal", "Location"],
["bombeiros", "Organization"],
["Águas de Moura", "Location"]
]

Note that some entities may belong to more than one class. For example, "Palmela" could be classified as both a Location and a Facility, depending on the context.

This task requires a good understanding of natural language processing and named entity recognition techniques. You can use any programming language or library you prefer to solve this task. Good luck!
