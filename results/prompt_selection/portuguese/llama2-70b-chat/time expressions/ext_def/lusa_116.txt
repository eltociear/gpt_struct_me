["hoje", "18:16"]

Explanation:
The input text contains two time expressions: "hoje" (today) and "18:16" (6:16 PM).

Note:
The format of the output is a JSON-parseable list of strings, which means that each element in the list is a string representing a time expression, and the list is surrounded by square brackets and uses commas to separate the elements.
