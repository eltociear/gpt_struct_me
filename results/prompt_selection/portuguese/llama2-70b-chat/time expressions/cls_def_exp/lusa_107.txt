Explanation:
The input text contains several temporal expressions that can be classified into different categories. Here's a breakdown of each expression and its corresponding class:

1. "Mulher atropelada" - Date (specific point in time)
2. "hoje" - Date (specific point in time)
3. "12:50" - Time (specific time)
4. "Torreira" - Set (specific location)
5. "uma semana" - Duration (time period)
6. "não poderem trabalhar" - Duration (time period)

The output is a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity (the temporal expression), and the second string is the class (Date, Time, Duration,or Set).
