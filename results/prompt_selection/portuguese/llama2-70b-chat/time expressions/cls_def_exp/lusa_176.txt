Explanation:
The input text contains several temporal expressions:

* "hoje" (today) is a date expression and should be classified as such.
* "06:55" (6:55 AM) is a time expression and should be classified as such.
* "34 anos" (34 years) is a duration expression and should be classified as such.
* "uma VMER" (a medical emergency and reanimation vehicle) is a set expression and should be classified as such.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list with four elements, each containing the temporal expression and its corresponding class.
