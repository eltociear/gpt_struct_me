[
["hoje", "Date"],
["52 anos", "Duration"],
["07:50", "Time"]
]

Explanation:
The input text contains three time expressions: "hoje" (today), "52 anos" (52 years), and "07:50" (7:50 AM). The output list contains these three expressions, each paired with its corresponding class: "Date" for "hoje", "Duration" for "52 anos", and "Time" for "07:50".

Note that the class "Set" is not present in this output, as there are no time expressions in the input text that would match this class.
