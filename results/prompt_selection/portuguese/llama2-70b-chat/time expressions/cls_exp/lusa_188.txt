Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions:

* "Homem de 48 anos" - This is a date expression, as it refers to a person's age.
* "hoje" - This is a time expression, as it means "today".
* "17 horas" - This is a time expression, as it refers to a specific time of day.
* "48 anos" - This is a date expression, as it refers to a person's age.
* "trata-se" - This is a duration expression, as it means "it takes place" or "it happens".
* "acidente" - This is a set expression, as it refers to a specific event or situation.

The output is a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is theentity (time expression), and the second string is the class (Date, Time, Duration, or Set).
