[
["2017", "Date"],
["hoje", "Date"],
["desde essa altura e até a atualidade", "Duration"],
["algumas vezes", "Set"]
]

Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions:

* "2017" is a date and should be classified as such.
* "hoje" means "today" in Portuguese and is also a date, so it should be classified as a date.
* "desde essa altura e até a atualidade" means "since that time until the present" and should be classified as a duration.
* "algumas vezes" means "sometimes" and should be classified as a set (a collection of items that may have some elements in common).

Therefore, the output should be a list of four elements, each containing the time expression and its corresponding class:

[
["2017", "Date"],
["hoje", "Date"],
["desde essa altura e até a atualidade", "Duration"],
["algumas vezes", "Set"]
]

This output can be easily parsed and used by a machine learning model to train and evaluate its performance on time expression classification tasks.
