Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions:

* "hoje à tarde" (this afternoon)
* "60 e 70 anos" (between 60 and 70 years old)
* "hoje" (today)

The output is a list of pairs, where each pair consists of the time expression and its corresponding class. The classes are:

* Time: for expressions that refer to a specific time of day or a time period (e.g. "hoje à tarde", "hoje")
* Date: for expressions that refer to a specific date or age (e.g. "60 e 70 anos")
* Duration: for expressions that refer to a length of time (e.g. "uma hora")
* Set: for expressions that refer to a specific set of items (e.g. "Lagoa", "Faro")

Note that the input text also contains place names, which are not time expressions and therefore are not included in the output.
