Explanation:
The input text contains four time expressions: "hoje" (today), "20:20" (8:20 PM), "nenhum" (none), and "20:20" (8:20 PM) again.

"Hoje" is classified as a Date.
The first "20:20" is classified as a Time.
The second "20:20" is classified as a Duration, since it's used to indicate the time the incident occurred.
"Nenhum" is classified as a Set, since it's used to indicate the absence of a value.

Note that the output is a JSON-parseable list, where each element is a list with two strings: the entity (the time expression) and the class (Date, Time, Duration, or Set).
