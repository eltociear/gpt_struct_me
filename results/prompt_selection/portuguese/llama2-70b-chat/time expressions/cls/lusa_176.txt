["hoje", "Date"],
["06:55", "Time"],
["34", "Duration"],
["10-8", "Set"]
]

Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions:

* "hoje" (today) is a date expression and should be classified as such.
* "06:55" (6:55 AM) is a time expression and should be classified as "Time".
* "34" (34 years old) is a duration expression and should be classified as "Duration".
* "10-8" (Estrada Nacional 10-8) is a set expression and should be classified as "Set".

The output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity (time expression), and the second string is the class (Date, Time, Duration, or Set).
