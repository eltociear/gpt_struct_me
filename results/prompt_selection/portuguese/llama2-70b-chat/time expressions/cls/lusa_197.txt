Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions:

* "hoje" (today) is a date expression and should be classified as such.
* "52 anos" (52 years) is a duration expression and should be classified as such.
* "07:50" (7:50 AM) is a time expression and should be classified as such.
* "52" (52 years) is also a duration expression and should be classified as such.

The output is a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity (time expression), and the second string is the class (Date, Time, Duration, or Set).
