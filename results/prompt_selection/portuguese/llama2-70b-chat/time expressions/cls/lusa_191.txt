Explanation:
The input text contains several time expressions:

* "hoje" (today) is a date expression and should be classified as such.
* "29 anos" (29 years) is a date expression and should be classified as such.
* "10:54" (10:54 AM) is a time expression and should be classified as such.
* "pelo" (around) is a duration expression and should be classified as such.
* "14:34" (2:34 PM) is a time expression and should be classified as such.
* "preservado" (preserved) is a set expression and should be classified as such.

The output should be a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings: the first string is the entity (time expression), and the second string is the class (Date, Time, Duration, or Set).
