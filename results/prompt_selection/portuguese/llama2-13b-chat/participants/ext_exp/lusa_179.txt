Note:

* Participants are identified based on their mention in the text, and may include people, organizations, locations, and objects.
* Participants are listed in the order they appear in the text.

For example, if the text is:

"The cat chased the mouse. The mouse ran into the hole."

The output might be:

["cat", "mouse", "hole"]

In this case, the cat, mouse, and hole are all participants in the text. The cat chased the mouse, and the mouse ran into the hole.
