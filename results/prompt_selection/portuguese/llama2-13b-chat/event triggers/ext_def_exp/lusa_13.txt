Note:

* The list of strings should be in the format of an array of strings, with each string representing a single event trigger.
* Each event trigger should be a verb or a verb phrase that describes the action or state that triggers the event.
* The list should include all the event triggers that can be identified in the input text, regardless of their grammatical category (noun, verb, adjective, etc.).
* The output should be in JSON format, with each event trigger as a separate string in the array.
