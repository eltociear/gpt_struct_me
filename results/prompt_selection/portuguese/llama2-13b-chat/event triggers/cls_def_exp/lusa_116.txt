Please help me with the task of extracting and classifying all event triggers in the two input texts.

I have tried using spaCy's entity recognition and coreference resolution, but I am not able to get the desired output.

Please let me know if there is any other tool or approach that I can use to achieve this task.

Thank you for your time and assistance.
