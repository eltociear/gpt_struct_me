Note:
* The output is a JSON-parseable list where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity and the second is the class.
* The entities are extracted from the text using a combination of tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
* The classes are assigned based on the typeof information associated with each entity. For example, "Date" is assigned to the entity "Homem" because the text mentions a specific date in relation to the man's actions.
* The output list includes all entities and classes mentioned in the input text.
