Explanation:
The task is to extract time expressions from the given text and classify them into three categories: Date, Time, and Set.
The input text contains several time expressions, including "10:54", "14:34", and "hoje" (which means "today"). These time expressions can be extracted and classified using the provided format, where each element is a list with two strings: the entity and the class.
For example, the time expression "10:54" can be extracted and classified as a "Time" entity with the class "10:54". Similarly, the location "Lisboa" can be extracted and classified as a "Location" entity with the class "Lisboa".
The output should be a JSON-parseable list of time expressions, where each element represents a time expression and its corresponding class.
