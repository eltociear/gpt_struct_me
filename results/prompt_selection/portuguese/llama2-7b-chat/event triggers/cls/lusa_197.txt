Explanation:
The output is a JSON-parseable list of objects, where each object represents an event trigger. The "entity" field contains the name of the entity that triggered the event, and the "class" field contains the class of the trigger.
In this case, there are six event triggers:
* Occurrence: The derrubade of the post by the crane's arm.
* Aspectual: The post.
* Perception: The man of 52 years old.
* Intensional State: Theman of 52 years old (as the event trigger is the man's state of being hit by the crane's arm).
* Intensional State: The funcionário de bombas de gasolina (as the event trigger is the man's state of being hit by the crane's arm).
Note that the class labels are not always straightforward, and may require some interpretation. For example, the "Aspectual" class may be assigned to a noun that is not the direct object of the action, but is related to the action in some way.
