Explanation:
The output is a JSON-parseable list of event triggers, where each element is a list with two strings. The first string is the entity, and the second string is the class.
In this example, theentities are:
* Homem (Man)
* Desentendimento (Desentendimento) (Occurrence)
* Arma branca (White weapon) (Aspectual)
* Indivíduo (Individual) (Aspectual)
* Tentativa de fuga (Attempted flight) (Action)
* Suspeito (Suspect) (Aspectual)
* Polícia (Police) (Agent)
* PJ (Public Prosecution Office) (Agent)
* Local do crime (Crime scene) (Aspectual)

The classes are:

* State (State)
* Occurrence (Occurrence)
* Aspectual (Aspectual)
* Action (Action)
* Agent (Agent)

Each element in the output represents a trigger event, which is a combination of an entity and a class. For example, the first element in the output represents the event "Homem (Man) - State", which means that a man was in a state of being. The second element represents the event "Desentendimento (Desentendimento) - Occurrence",which means that an occurrence of a disagreement happened.
The output can be used to train a machine learning model to classify events in text data, or to generate a summary of the events in the text.
